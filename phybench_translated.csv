495,OPTICS,"In 1845, Faraday studied the influence of electricity and magnetism on polarized light and discovered that heavy glass, originally non-optically active, exhibited optical activity under the influence of a strong magnetic field, causing the plane of polarization of polarized light to rotate. This was the first time humanity recognized the relationship between electromagnetic phenomena and light phenomena. The magneto-optical rotation effect later became known as the Faraday Effect.

In the magneto-optical rotation effect, the rotation angle of the vibration plane \(\beta\) is proportional to the distance \(d\) that light travels through the medium and is also proportional to the magnetic induction intensity \(B\) within the medium, expressed as:
\[
\beta = vBd
\]
where \(v\) is the proportionality constant, known as the Verdet constant, which depends on the properties of the medium and is also related to the wavelength of the incident light. Assume that the medium can be modeled using the Lorentz model, where the medium is composed of atoms, with \(N\) atoms per unit volume, and each atom contains \(Z\) electrons in the outer shell. The outer electrons deviate from their equilibrium positions and are subject to linear restoring forces: \(\vec{f} = -k\vec{r}\), with the harmonic resonance frequency of the outer shell electrons being \(\omega_0\). The interaction between the incident light and the medium exclusively involves the outer shell electrons.

Circularly polarized light can be regarded as the result of the synthesis of two linearly polarized light waves with the same frequency and direction, mutually perpendicular vibration axes, and a stable phase relationship. The two linearly polarized light waves have the same amplitude and a phase difference of \(\pm\pi/2\), representing left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light, respectively. Similarly, a linearly polarized light wave can be decomposed into left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized components.

Based on these models, calculate the Verdet constant \(\beta\) for incident light with an angular frequency of \(\omega\). Assume that the medium does not absorb the incident light and its refractive index near the angular frequency \(\omega\) is \(n\).","Solution: The propagation of light waves in a medium under an applied magnetic field involves the motion of electrons:
\[m\ddot{\vec{r}} = -k\vec{r} - g\vec{v} - e(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})\]
\(\vec{E}\) is the electric field intensity of the incident light wave; \(\vec{B}\) is the magnetic induction intensity applied to the medium; \(g\) is the damping term, and since the medium does not absorb the incident light, it exhibits weak damping and low loss, thus neglecting the damping term:
\[m\ddot{\vec{r}} = -k\vec{r} - e(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})\]
Let \(\vec{B}\) be along the positive \(z\)-axis, which is also the propagation direction of the light wave, thus:
\[
\begin{cases}
m\ddot{x} + e\dot{y}B + kx = -eE_x \\
m\ddot{y} - e\dot{x}B + ky = -eE_y
\end{cases}
\]
Assuming the incident wave is a steady-state wave, the relationship between the electric field and time: \(e^{-i\omega t}\)
The relationship between the perturbation term of the forced vibration of the outer electrons and time: \(e^{-i\omega t}\)
Thus: \(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \equiv -i\omega\), \(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} \equiv -\omega^2\), therefore:
\[
\begin{cases}
(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)r_x - i\omega\Omega r_y = -\frac{e}{m}E_x \\
(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)r_y + i\omega\Omega r_x = -\frac{e}{m}E_y
\end{cases}
\]
Where:
\(\Omega = \frac{eB}{m}\), \(\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\)

For left-hand circularly polarized light, \(E_+ = E_x + iE_y\), then: \(r_+ = r_x + ir_y\)
\[(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 - \omega\Omega)r_+ = -\frac{e}{m}E_+\]
Solving this, we get:
\[r_+ = -\frac{e}{m(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 - \omega\Omega)}E_+\]
The polarization vector: The atomic number density of the medium is \(N(1/m^3)\), with each atom providing \(Z\) electrons weakly bound in the outer layer;
\[\vec{P}_+ = NZ(-e)\vec{r}_+ = \frac{NZ\frac{e^2}{m}}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 - \omega\Omega}E_+\]
Since \(P = \varepsilon_0\chi E\), thus:
\[\chi_+ = \frac{NZ\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 m}}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 - \omega\Omega}\]
The refractive index for left-hand circularly polarized light is:
\[n_+^2 = \varepsilon_+ = (1 + \chi_+) = 1 + \frac{NZ\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 m}}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 - \omega\Omega}\]

For right-hand circularly polarized light \(E_- = E_x - iE_y\), then: \(r_- = r_x - ir_y\)
\[(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 + \omega\Omega)r_- = -\frac{e}{m}E_-\]
Solving this, we get:
\[r_- = -\frac{e}{m(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 + \omega\Omega)}E_-\]
\[\vec{P}_- = NZ(-e)\vec{r}_- = \frac{NZ\frac{e^2}{m}}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 + \omega\Omega}E_-\]
Thus:
\[\chi_- = \frac{NZ\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 m}}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 + \omega\Omega}\]
The refractive index for right-hand circularly polarized light is:
\[n_-^2 = \varepsilon_- = (1 + \chi_-) = 1 + \frac{NZ\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 m}}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 + \omega\Omega}\]
That is, the refractive indices for left-hand and right-hand circularly polarized light are different:
\[n_{\pm}^2 = \varepsilon_{\pm} = (1 + \chi_{\pm}) = 1 + \frac{NZ\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 m}}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 \mp \omega\Omega}\]

Any linearly polarized light can be decomposed into two circularly polarized lights with the same frequency, equal amplitude, and a stable phase relationship. When linearly polarized light passes through a medium with an external magnetic field aligned with the direction of propagation, the rotation angle of the polarization plane is:
\[\beta = \frac{1}{2}(\alpha_+ - \alpha_-) = \frac{\pi}{\lambda}(n_+ - n_-)d\]
where \(d\) is the propagation length of light in the medium.

Find \((n_+ - n_-)\)
\[
\begin{align*}
n_+^2 - n_-^2 &= (n_+ - n_-)(n_+ + n_-)\\
&= NZ\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 m} \cdot \frac{2\omega\Omega}{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2 - (\omega\Omega)^2}
\end{align*}
\]
Generally, the cyclotron frequency \(\Omega\) is much smaller than the optical frequency \(\omega\), and the optical frequency \(\omega\) is not near the resonance frequency \(\omega_0\), hence:
\[n_+ + n_- \approx 2n\]
\[n^2 \approx 1 + NZ\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 m} \cdot \frac{1}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2}\]
Therefore:
\[n_+ - n_- = NZ\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 mn} \cdot \frac{\omega\Omega}{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2}\]
Thus:
\[
\begin{align*}
\beta &= \frac{\pi}{\lambda}(n_+ - n_-)d = \frac{\omega}{2c}NZ\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 mn} \cdot \frac{\omega\Omega}{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2}Bd = \frac{NZ e^3}{2c\varepsilon_0 m^2 n} \cdot \frac{\omega^2}{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2} \cdot Bd\\
&= vBd
\end{align*}
\]
The Verdet constant is obtained as:
\[v = \frac{NZ e^3}{2c\varepsilon_0 m^2 n} \cdot \frac{\omega^2}{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2}\]",\[v = \frac{NZ e^3}{2c\varepsilon_0 m^2 n} \cdot \frac{\omega^2}{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2}\]

285,MECHANICS,"A small bug with a mass of $m$ crawls on a disk with a radius of $2R$. Relative to the disk, its crawling trajectory is a circle of radius $R$ that passes through the center of the disk. The disk rotates with a constant angular velocity $\omega$ about an axis passing through its center and perpendicular to the plane of the disk. The bug's angular crawling velocity relative to the disk is in the same direction as the disk's angular velocity and has the same magnitude. Solve for the maximum force $F_{max}$ between the bug and the disk required to maintain this motion (neglecting gravity).","The problem can use the acceleration transformation formula for rotating reference frames, where the actual acceleration of the small insect  

$$
\overrightarrow{a}=\overrightarrow{a}+2\overrightarrow{\omega}\times\overrightarrow{v}+\dot{\overrightarrow{\omega}}\times\overrightarrow{r}-\omega^{2}\overrightarrow{r}
$$

Here, $\vec{a}^{\prime}$ is the acceleration relative to the rotating system, and since the rotating system is a uniform circular motion,  

$$
\dot{a_{\mathrm{\scriptsize~=~}}}\omega^{2}R
$$

is the speed relative to the rotating system, with a magnitude of $\omega R$. Thus, the magnitude of the Coriolis acceleration is:  

$$
2\omega v^{'}=2\omega^{2}R
$$

The last term is the centripetal acceleration, which is directly proportional to the distance from the insect to the center of the disk,  

$$
\omega^{2}r=2\omega^{2}R\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)

A concentric spherical shell with inner and outer radii of $R_{1}=R$ and $R_{2}=2^{1/3}R$, and magnetic permeability $\mu=3\mu_{0}$, is placed in an external uniform magnetic field with magnetic flux density $B_{0}$ and the magnetic field generated by a fixed magnetic dipole located at the center of the sphere. The magnetic dipole has a magnetic moment $m$ that is aligned with the external magnetic field. The system reaches magnetostatic equilibrium. To solve this problem, we can use the method of magnetic scalar potential. The concept is to express the magnetic field intensity as ${\pmb{H}}=-\nabla\varphi$, where $\varphi$ is referred to as the magnetic scalar potential. This approach applies to all three regions: the space inside the shell, the space outside the shell, and the region within the shell itself. The relationship between magnetic flux density and magnetic field intensity is $B=\mu H$.

If the magnetic moment is rotated by an angle $\alpha$, calculate the torque it experiences. The answer should be expressed in terms of $m$, $B_0$, and $\alpha$. Please verify the result before outputting.

453,ELECTRICITY,"Most media exhibit absorption of light, where the intensity of light decreases as it penetrates deeper into the medium.

Let monochromatic parallel light (with angular frequency $\omega$) pass through a uniform medium with a refractive index of $n$. Experimental results show that, over a reasonably wide range of light intensities, after passing through a small thickness, the decrease in light intensity is proportional to both the light intensity itself and this small thickness. The proportionality coefficient is denoted as $\alpha$.

Next, we will estimate the coefficient $\alpha$ based on the classical oscillator model of atoms. In this model, the atomic nucleus can be considered stationary, while the electron, when in motion, is bound by the nucleus. This binding force can be approximated as a linear restoring force: $-m\omega_{0}^{2}x$. Here, $\mathsf{m}$ is the mass of the electron, $\omega_{0}$ is the natural angular frequency (describing the strength of the restoring force), and $x$ is the distance between the electron and the nucleus. Simultaneously, when the electron is in motion, there often exists a damping force: $-m\gamma v$. However, since the damping is usually quite weak, it can be approximately assumed that the electron undergoes simple harmonic motion within any given period.

Additionally, it is important to know that the power of radiation emitted by a charged particle in accelerated motion is given by:

$$
P = {\frac{e^{2}{\overline{{{\dot{v}}^{2}}}}}{6\pi\varepsilon_{0}c^{3}}}
$$  

Based on this model, derive the expression for $\alpha$.  

**Hint**: The primary interaction between electromagnetic waves and the medium originates from the contribution of the electric field component. $e$ is the magnitude of the electron charge, $\overline{{{\dot{v}}^{2}}}$ represents the average value of the square of the acceleration, $\gamma$ is a positive constant, $\varepsilon_{0}$ is the vacuum permittivity, $v$ is the velocity of the electron, $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, and $N$ is the number density of electrons.","The dynamics equation for electrons:

$$
m\ddot{x}=-m\gamma\dot{x}-m\omega_{0}^2x-eE_0e^{i\omega t}
$$

Substituting $x=\tilde{x}e^{i\omega t}$ yields $\tilde{x}=\frac{-eE_0/m}{-\omega^2+\omega_0^2+i\gamma \omega}$

$$
\tilde{v}=i\omega \tilde{x}=\frac{-i\omega eE_0/m}{-\omega^2+\omega_0^2+i\gamma \omega}
$$

$$
\dot{\tilde{v}}=\frac{-\omega^2 eE_0/m}{-\omega^2+\omega_0^2+i\gamma \omega}
$$

$$
\overline{\dot{v^2}}=\frac{\frac{1}{2}(\omega^2 eE_0/m)^2}{(\omega_0^2-\omega^2)^2+\gamma^2 \omega^2}
$$

$$
P=-\frac{e^2\overline{\dot{v^2}}}{6\pi\epsilon_0 c^3}=-\frac{1}{12\pi\epsilon_0 c^3}\frac{(\omega^2 e^2 E_0/m)^2}{(\omega_0^2-\omega^2)^2+\gamma^2 \omega^2}

The energy flux density of the electromagnetic wave:

$$
I=\frac{1}{2}nc\epsilon_0E_0^2

$$
\alpha=-\frac{dI}{Idx}=-\frac{NP}{I}

281,THERMODYNAMICS,"Due to the imbalance of molecular forces on the surface layer of a liquid, tension will arise along any boundary of the surface layer. In this context, the so-called ""capillary phenomenon"" occurs, affecting the geometric shape of a free liquid surface. Assume a static large container exists in a uniform atmosphere. The container holds a liquid in static equilibrium, and its side walls are vertical planes. The contact angle between the liquid and the side wall is $\theta$ $(0 < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2})$, the density of the liquid is $\rho$, its surface tension coefficient is $\sigma$, atmospheric pressure is $p_{0}$, and the gravitational acceleration is $g$.  

Find the additional height $h$ of the liquid surface rise at the junction between the container wall and the liquid surface due to the capillary phenomenon, expressing the result using $\theta, \rho, \sigma, g$.  
Hint: The formula for the radius of curvature in a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is: $R = {\frac{(1+z^{\prime}(x)^{2})^{\frac{3}{2}}}{\mid z^{\prime\prime}(x)\mid}}$.","Choose $x\sim x+\mathrm{d}x.$ , analyze the surface microelement of the liquid located at a height between $z\sim z+\mathrm{d}z$, considering the liquid pressure $p_{i}$ at that point, it is evident that:  

$$
p_{0}=p_{i}+\rho g z
$$  

Next, consider the forces perpendicular to the liquid surface. From the Laplace's additional pressure formula:  

$$
p_{i}+\frac{\sigma}{R}=p_{0}
$$  

$R$ is the radius of curvature of the liquid surface equation at that point. By combining equations (5) and (6), we obtain:  

$$
z=z(x)=\cfrac{\sigma}{\rho g R}=\cfrac{\sigma z^{\""v}(x)}{\rho g(1+z^{\prime}(x)^{2})^{\frac{3}{2}}}
$$  

Note that here, due to the concave shape of the liquid surface, $z""(x)$ is positive.  

Integrate equation (7):  

$$
\int_{h}^{0}z\mathrm{d}z=\frac{\sigma}{\rho g}\int_{h}^{0}\frac{z^{\prime}(x)}{\left(1+z^{\prime}(x)^{2}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}}\mathrm{d}z=\frac{\sigma}{\rho g}\int_{z^{\prime}(0)}^{z^{\prime}(\infty)}\frac{\mathrm{d}z^{\prime}(x)}{\left(1+z^{\prime}(x)^{2}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}}=\frac{\sigma}{\rho g}\int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z\left(\left(x\right)^{2}\right)}}}^{\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z\left(0\right)^{2}}}}\mathrm{d}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z^{\prime}(x)^{2}}}\right)
$$  

Here, the boundary conditions are specifically pointed out: $z(0)=h,z(\infty)=0,z^{\prime}(\infty)=0$ (the liquid surface approaches horizontal infinitely far away). Thus, $h$ can be expressed as:  

$$
\frac{1}{2}h^{2}=\frac{\sigma}{\rho g}[1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z^{\prime}(0)^{2}}}]
$$  

The contact angle $\theta$ satisfies:  

$$
z^{\prime}(0)=\tan(\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta)=-\cot\theta

Initially, the particle is at rest, hanging vertically. The carriage slides frictionlessly along a track in the $x$-direction. Suddenly, the carriage is acted upon by a constant forward force $F$ in the $x$-direction. Determine the expression for the $x$-coordinate of the particle relative to the carriage's reference frame as a function of time $t$. Use the small-angle approximation. At $t=0$, $x=0$. Express the answer in terms of $M$ and $\Omega$.

$$

Assume the coordinate of the carriage is $x$. Then the Coriolis force acting on the small ball is:  

$$
(C_{x},C_{y})=\Big(2m\Omega\dot{y},-2m\Omega(\dot{X}+\dot{x})\Big)

Newton's laws:  

$$

$$

$$
F_{y}+C_{y}=m{\ddot{y}}

$$

$$
X_{1}, x_{1}, y_{1}=A, B, C\mathrm{e}^{i\omega t}

Taking the determinant of the coefficient matrix equal to zero allows it to be factored:  

$$
\omega^{2}\left(\omega^{2}-6\Omega^{2}\right)\left(\omega^{2}-19\Omega^{2}\right)=0
$$

The case $\omega^{2}=0$ corresponds to the trivial solution:  

$$
X_{1}, x_{1}, y_{1}=C_{1}, 0, 0
$$

The solution for $\omega=\sqrt{6}\Omega$ is:  

$$
X_{1}, x_{1}, y_{1}=C_{2}, -6C_{2}, \frac{5\sqrt{6}}{2}\mathrm{i}C_{2}\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\omega t}

$$
X_{1}, x_{1}, y_{1}=C_{3}, -19C_{3}, -4\sqrt{19}\mathrm{i}C_{3}\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\omega t}

By superimposing these three solutions and considering the initial conditions:  

$$

$$

$$

The stick figure is composed of a head, a torso, two arms, and two legs. Initially, the stick figure is in a state where $\theta=\textstyle{\frac{\pi}{2}}$ and $\varphi={\frac{\pi}{4}}$. The head has a mass of $m=0.6\lambda l$, with the result expressed in terms of $\lambda$. 

The stick figure is a simulation of a real biological body, so if necessary, the connections between the torso and the arms/legs, in addition to providing interaction forces, can also exert a couple (i.e., a torque), even if there is no interaction force between them. This net torque is independent of the choice of reference point. In the following discussion, this will be referred to simply as a ""couple.""

The thin rod has a mass of $m$ and a length of $L$ ($d-R<L<\sqrt{d^{2}-R^{2}}$). Initially, the point of contact and the line connecting the sphere's center lie in the same vertical plane as the rod. Now, a small perturbation is applied, causing the system to begin rotating as a whole without relative sliding around the horizontal axis.

250,ELECTRICITY,"

There is now an electrolyte with thickness $L$ in the $z$ direction, infinite in the $x$ direction, and infinite in the $y$ direction. The region where $y > 0$ is electrolyte 1, and the region where $y < 0$ is electrolyte 2. The conductivities of the two dielectrics are $\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}$, and the dielectric constants are $\varepsilon_{1}, \varepsilon_{2}$, respectively. On the $xOz$ interface of the two dielectrics, two cylindrical holes with a radius $R$ are drilled in the $z$ direction, spaced $2D (D > R, R, D \ll L)$ apart, with centers located on the interface as long straight cylindrical holes. Two cylindrical bodies $\pm$ are inserted into the holes, with the type of the cylinders given by the problem text below.

The cylindrical bodies $\pm$ are metal electrodes filling the entire cylinder. Initially, the system is uncharged, and at $t=0$, a power source with an electromotive force $U$ and internal resistance $r_{0}$ is used to connect the electrodes. Find the relationship between the current through the power source and time, denoted as $i(t)$.","Given the potential difference $u$, it can be seen:

$$
\varphi_{+}=u/2,\varphi_{-}=-u/2,\lambda=\frac{2\pi(\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{2})\varphi_{+}}{2\xi_{+}}=\frac{\pi(\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{2})u}{\operatorname{arccosh}(\mathrm{D/R})}
$$  

Select a surface encapsulating the cylindrical surface and examine Gauss's theorem. For the positive electrode, it is easy to see:

$$
\iint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{S}=L\oint\vec{E}\cdot\hat{n}d l=\frac{\lambda L}{(\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{2})/2}=\frac{2\pi u L}{2\mathrm{arccosh}(D/R)}
$$  

Since the above potential distribution is deemed directly applicable for the calculation of current, the total current flowing out of the positive electrode is:

$$
I=\iint\sigma\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{S}=\frac{\sigma_{1}+\sigma_{2}}{2}\times\frac{2\pi u L}{2\mathrm{arccosh}(D/R)}
$$  

Given the current $i$ passing through the power source, this current changes the net charge:

$$
{\frac{d(\lambda L)}{d t}}=i-I=i-{\frac{2\pi u L}{2\mathrm{arccosh}(D/R)}}={\frac{\pi(\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{2})L}{2\mathrm{arccosh}(D/R)}}{\frac{d u}{d t}}
$$  

According to the loop voltage drop equation:

$$
\begin{array}{l l}{{U=r_{0}i+u\rightarrow u=U-r_{0}i}}\ {{\rightarrow i-{\displaystyle\frac{\pi(\sigma_{1}+\sigma_{2})L}{2\mathrm{arccosh}(D/R)}}}(U-r_{0}i)=-{\displaystyle\frac{\pi(\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{2})L}{2\mathrm{arccosh}(D/R)}}r_{0}{\displaystyle\frac{d i}{d t}}}\ {{\rightarrow{\displaystyle\frac{d i}{d t}}={\displaystyle\frac{(\sigma_{1}+\sigma_{2})U}{r_{0}(\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{2})}}-\left(\frac{\sigma_{1}+\sigma_{2}}{\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{2}}+{\displaystyle\frac{2\mathrm{arccosh}(D/R)}{\pi r_{0}L(\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{2})}}\right)i}}\end{array}
$$  

At time $t=0$, all current should preferentially enter the capacitor. At this time, the initial current is $U/r_{0}$, and this differential equation yields:

$$

409,ELECTRICITY,"In electromagnetism, we often study the problem of electromagnetic field distribution in a region without charge or current distribution. In such cases, the electromagnetic field will become a tubular field. The so-called tubular field is named because of the nature of the velocity field of an incompressible fluid at every instant. Its characteristic can be described using the language of vector analysis as the field's divergence being equal to zero. Another perspective is that if we take the field lines of a vector field $\pmb{F}$ (the tangent line at each point being the direction of field strength) and select a flux tube along a set of field lines passing through a certain cross-section, then at any cross-section of the flux tube, the field flux:

$$
\int F\cdot\mathrm{d}S=\Phi
$$  

will be a conserved quantity. This problem will investigate a special case of a tubular field that is rotationally symmetric around the $z$ axis: using oblate spheroidal coordinates to construct a unique tubular field as an electric field or magnetic field. The so-called oblate spheroidal coordinate system is similar to spherical coordinates, and it is generated by the following coordinate transformations:

$$
x= a \mathrm{ch}\mu \cos \nu \cos \varphi
$$  

$$
y= a \mathrm{ch}\mu \cos \nu \sin \varphi
$$  

$$
z=a\mathrm{sh}\mu\sin\nu
$$  

We want the shape of the field lines of an electric field or magnetic field to precisely follow its generatrix direction, i.e., the tangent direction of the curve where field strength changes with $\mu$ while $\nu,\varphi$ remain fixed (upwards when $\relax z>0$). 

Find the charge distribution in the $xy$ plane that can produce this electric field distribution. Assume the field strength near the origin is $E_0$. The dielectric constant is $\varepsilon_{0}$.","First, we determine the equation of the constant-$\mu$ line. Now, using the trigonometric identity $\sin^{2}\nu+\cos^{2}\nu=1$, we eliminate the parameter $\nu$:

$$
{\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}{\mathrm{ch}}^{2}\mu}}+{\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2}{\mathrm{sh}}^{2}\mu}}=1
$$

Its physical significance is that, for an electric field, it forms a surface of equal potential. This is based on the fact that equipotential surfaces should always be perpendicular to the electric field lines. The constant-$\mu$ lines, being ellipses, satisfy this condition: their tangent directions are aligned with the external bisectors of angles formed by lines connecting the two foci, and they are perpendicular to the tangent directions of the hyperbolic electric field lines, which correspond to the internal bisectors.

Next, we determine an inverse transformation. For a point in the first quadrant with coordinates $(x, z)$, the distances to the two foci are:

$$
r_{+}=\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}\quad,\quad r_{-}=\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}
$$

Thus, the semi-major axis lengths of the ellipse and hyperbola are respectively:

$$
r_{+}+r_{-}=2a\mathrm{ch}\mu
$$

$$
r_{+}-r_{-}=2a\cos\nu
$$

These two equations help convert Cartesian coordinates into generalized coordinates $\mu$ and $\nu$. Next, we utilize the following property: the infinitesimal displacement caused by an increase in $\mu$ between equipotential surfaces is the derivative of the coordinates with respect to $\mu$:

$$
\mathrm{d}x=a\mathrm{sh}\mu\cos\nu\mathrm{d}\mu\quad,\quad\mathrm{d}z=a\mathrm{ch}\mu\sin\nu\mathrm{d}\mu
$$

We proceed to calculate the length of this displacement:

$$
\mathrm{d}s={\sqrt{\mathrm{d}x^{2}+\mathrm{d}z^{2}}}=a{\sqrt{\mathrm{ch}^{2}\mu-\cos^{2}\nu}}\mathrm{d}\mu
$$

Next, we consider the electric potential difference caused by displacements between one ellipse and another. This difference is equal to the electric field strength multiplied by the displacement length. Because the ellipses represent equipotential surfaces, this product is constant everywhere. In particular, taking $\nu=90^{\circ}$ places this point exactly on the $z$-axis, and the electric field strength at this location has already been computed in (2). We obtain the following equation:

$$
{\frac{E_{0}a^{2}}{a^{2}+a^{2}\mathrm{{sh}}^{2}\mu\sin^{2}{90^{\circ}}}}\cdot a\mathrm{{ch}}\mu\mathrm{{d}}\mu=E\cdot a{\sqrt{\mathrm{{ch}}^{2}\mu-\cos^{2}\nu}}\mathrm{{d}}\mu
$$

This gives the distribution of electric field strength. To determine the direction of electric field lines, we only need to locate the bisector of the angle formed by lines connecting the two foci:

$$
\theta={\frac{\theta_{+}+\theta_{-}}{2}}
$$

$$
\tan\theta_{\pm}={\frac{z}{x\pm a}}
$$

We organize the result:

$$
f(x,z)={\frac{2a^{2}}{\left[{\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}}+{\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}}\right]^{2}}}\left[\left[{\frac{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}}\right]^{\frac{1}{4}}+\left[{\frac{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}}\right]^{\frac{1}{4}}\right]~.
$$

With $z=0$, $x=r$, we obtain:

$$
f(r)=\frac{2a^{2}}{(r+a+|r-a|)\sqrt{|r^{2}-a^{2}|}}
$$

For the electric field, a charged circular disk with radius $a$ is required to generate it. In this case, the field strength at $r<a$ is:

$$
E=E_{0}f(r)={\frac{E_{0}a}{\sqrt{a^{2}-r^{2}}}}
$$

By symmetry and Gauss's law:

$$
E=\frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_{0}}
$$

Thus, the surface charge density on the disk is:

$$
\boxed{\sigma=\frac{2\varepsilon_{0}E_{0}a}{\sqrt{a^{2}-r^{2}}}}
$$","$$
\boxed{\sigma=\frac{2\varepsilon_{0}E_{0}a}{\sqrt{a^{2}-r^{2}}}}

133,MECHANICS,"A particle undergoes planar motion, where the $x$ component of its velocity $v_{x}$ remains constant. The radius of curvature at this moment is $R$. Determine the acceleration at this moment.","To solve for the radius of curvature, it's more appropriate to use the natural coordinate system. In this coordinate system, the tangential and normal components of acceleration are represented as:

$$
a_{\tau} = {\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}}, \quad a_{n} = {\frac{v^{2}}{R}}.
$$

Also, 

$$
v_{x} = v \cos\theta,
$$

where $\theta$ can be referenced in Figure 1.5. If we take the time derivative of equation (2) and consider that $v_{x}$ is a constant, we get:

$$
{\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}} = v {\dot{\theta}} \tan\theta.
$$

Since $\dot{\theta} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}s} \frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{v}{R}$, where $s$ is the arc length coordinate, substituting this relation into equation (3) gives:

$$
a_{\tau} = {\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}} = {\frac{v^{2}}{R}} \tan\theta.

From equations (1), (2), and (4), the magnitude of the particle's acceleration can be expressed as:

The central axes of both the circular cylinder and the elliptical cylinder are horizontal. The magnitude of gravitational acceleration is $g$. The circular cylinder is fixed and cannot rotate. Initially, the elliptical cylinder is in equilibrium at the bottom of the circular cylinder with its minor axis aligned vertically. Assuming the elliptical cylinder undergoes rolling without slipping inside the circular cylinder, derive the frequency $f$ of the small oscillations of the elliptical cylinder's center of mass near this equilibrium position.","The radius of curvature at the contact point is

\rho_{1}=\frac{a^{2}}{b}

Thus, in geometric terms, it can be equivalent to a cylinder whose center of mass is offset by $(\rho_{1}-b)$. Let the angle between the contact point and the cylinder center line be $\theta$, and the self-rotation angle of the elliptical cylinder be $\varphi$.

No-slip rolling gives  

$$

88,MODERN,"In a certain atom $A$, there are only two energy levels: the lower energy level $A_{0}$ is called the ground state, and the higher energy level $A^{\star}$ is called the excited state. The energy difference between the excited state and the ground state is $E_{0}$. When the atom is in the ground state, its rest mass is $m_{0}$; when it is in the excited state, due to its intrinsic instability, it will transition to the ground state while emitting photons externally. It is known that the probability of transition from the excited state to the ground state in unit time in the atom's rest reference frame is $\lambda$, and the probability of emitting photons in all directions is equal. At the initial moment, the total number of atoms is $N_{0}(N_{0}\gg1)$, and the experimental reference frame $S$ and the atom's proper reference frame $S^{\prime}$ are time-synchronized. All $N_{0}$ atoms are in the excited state and have a common velocity $\pmb{v}$ in the $+\hat{\pmb{x}}$ direction relative to the $S$ frame.

\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{d}E_{l i g h t}=P\mathrm{d}t}\ {\mathrm{d}E_{l i g h t}^{\prime}=P^{\prime}\mathrm{d}t^{\prime}}\end{array}

We obtain:

$$
P=P^{\prime}=\lambda N_{0}E_{0}e^{-\lambda\frac{\epsilon}{\gamma}}
$$  

Where:

$$
\gamma={\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-{\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}

Considering that number density is Lorentz invariant, let the number of photons emitted in $S$, within $\theta \sim \theta + \mathrm{d}\theta$, be $\dot{n}$.  

From the transformation of the photon energy and momentum, the relationship between $\pmb\theta^{\prime}$ and $\pmb\theta$ can be expressed as:

$$
\dot{n}\mathrm{d}t\times2\pi\sin\theta\mathrm{d}\theta=\frac{\dot{N}^{\prime}}{4\pi}\mathrm{d}t^{\prime}\times2\pi\sin\theta^{\prime}\mathrm{d}\theta^{\prime}

$$
\cos\theta^{\prime}=\frac{\cos\theta-\beta}{1-\beta\cos\theta}

And the transformation of time:

$$
\mathrm{d}t^{\prime}=\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}\mathrm{d}t

We further obtain the power distribution of the emitted light:

Following the position where the charge density term appears, add the divergence term of the magnetic field and the curl term of the electric field, we obtain:

The conservation of magnetic charge implies:  

$$
\frac{\partial\omega}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{k}=0

Since the curl of the electric field does not have divergence, the identity is obtained:   

$$
\lambda\frac{\nabla\cdot\pmb{k}}{c}-\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial\nabla\cdot\pmb{B}}{\partial t}=0

617,MECHANICS,"Consider each domino as a uniform, smooth slender rod with height $h$ and mass $m$ (neglecting thickness and width), connected to the ground with a smooth hinge. All rods are initially vertical to the ground and arranged evenly in a straight line, with the distance between adjacent rods being $l$, where $l \ll h$. The coefficient of restitution between the rods is $e = 0$. For convenience, assume that forces between the rods only occur at the instant of collision, and are otherwise negligible.  Assume there are infinitely many rods, all initially standing upright. At a certain moment, a disturbance is applied to the first rod, causing it to fall with a certain initial angular velocity. The angular velocity of each rod at the instant it is hit by the previous rod may vary, but as the dominoes collectively fall forward, this post-collision angular velocity will tend toward a certain value. Determine this value $\omega_{\infty}$.
","Suppose the initial angular velocity of the $n$th rod when it falls is $\omega _{n}$. From the beginning of the fall until it collides with the next rod, the angle through which the rod rotates is denoted as $\theta$. Since $l\ll h$, we have  $$\theta\approx\tan\theta\approx\sin\theta=\frac lh$$  Rigid body dynamics:  $$\frac12mgh\theta=\frac13mh^2\ddot{\theta}$$  Thus:  $\ddot{\theta}-\rho^2\theta=0$ where $\rho=\sqrt{\frac{3g}{2h}}$  The general solution is:  $\theta(t)=C_1\cosh\rho t+C_2\sinh\rho t$  With initial conditions  $$\theta(0)=0,\quad\dot{\theta}(0)=\omega_n$$  Therefore,  $$\theta(t)=\frac{\omega_n}{\rho}\sinh\rho t$$  The angle rotated by the $n$th rod before colliding with the $n+1$th rod:  $$\theta_0=\frac{l}{h}$$  Time required:  $$t_n=\dfrac{1}{\rho}\sinh^{-1}\dfrac{\rho l}{h\omega_n}$$  Using properties of hyperbolic functions  $$\cosh^2x-\sinh^2x=1$$  We obtain  $$\dot{\theta}(t_n)=\sqrt{\omega_n^2+\frac{\rho^2l^2}{h^2}}$$  At the moment of collision between the $n$th rod and the $n+1$th rod, the force and impulse must be along the horizontal direction. Let $\omega_n^{\prime}$ be the angular velocity of the $n$th rod after the collision. Angular momentum:  $$\dot{\theta}(t_n)=\omega_n^{\prime}+\omega_{n+1}$$  Inelastic collision:  $\sqrt{h^2-l^2}\omega_{n+1}-h\omega^{\prime}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{h^2-l^2}}h=e\left[h\dot{\theta}(t_n)\cdot\frac{\sqrt{h^2-l^2}}h-0\right]=0$  Solving yields  $$\omega_{n+1}^{2}=\frac14\omega_{n}^{2}+\frac14\frac{\rho^{2}l^{2}}{h^{2}}\\\omega_{n+1}^{2}-\frac13\frac{\rho^{2}l^{2}}{h^{2}}=\frac14\left(\omega_{n}^{2}-\frac13\frac{\rho^{2}l^{2}}{h^{2}}\right)$$  Solving this sequence gives the angular velocity of the $n$th rod just after collision  $$\omega_n=\sqrt{\frac{\omega_0^2}{4^n}+\frac{\rho^2l^2}{3h^2}\left(1-\frac1{4^n}\right)}$$  In this formula, $\omega_0$ is the initial angular velocity when the first rod starts to fall.

367,MECHANICS,"There is a smooth elliptical track, and the equation of the track satisfies $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ ($a > b > 0$). On the track, there is a small charged object that can move freely along the track, with mass $m$ and charge $q$. Now, a point charge with charge $Q$ (same sign as $q$) is placed at the origin. Find the period $T$ of the small oscillations of the charged object around its stable equilibrium position.","It is evident that at this point, the small object is in a stable equilibrium position at the two vertices of the major axis of the elliptical orbit. When the small object experiences a slight deviation along the orbit from the stable equilibrium position, as shown in the figure below, the distance from the small object to the origin O is \( r \), and the angle relative to the x-axis is \( \theta \) (\( \theta << 1 \)).

From the elliptical orbit equation, differentiating both sides, we have:
\[ \frac{2x dx}{a^2} + \frac{2y dy}{b^2} = 0 \]

This leads to the elliptic tangent slope at the point:
\[ \tan \alpha = \frac{a^2}{b^2} \tan \theta \]

The angle between the direction of the electrostatic force on the small object and the normal is:
\[ \beta = \alpha - \theta \]

Since the distance of the small object deviating from the stable equilibrium position is very small, we have \(\theta, \alpha, \beta << 1\), which implies:
\[ \beta = \alpha - \theta \approx \left( \frac{a^2}{b^2} - 1 \right) \theta \]

Magnitude of the electrostatic force on the small object:
\[ F = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{Qq}{r^2} \]

Where \( r \) satisfies:
\[ \frac{r^2 \cos^2 \theta}{a^2} + \frac{r^2 \sin^2 \theta}{b^2} = 1 \]

Thus, we obtain:
\[ r = \sqrt{\frac{a^2 b^2}{b^2 + (a^2 - b^2) \sin^2 \theta}} = a \left[ 1 + \frac{a^2 - b^2}{b^2} \sin^2 \theta \right]^{-\frac{1}{2}} \approx a \left[ 1 + \frac{a^2 - b^2}{b^2} \theta^2 \right]^{\frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ \approx a \left( 1 - \frac{a^2 - b^2}{2b^2} \theta^2 \right) \]

And the tangential component of the electrostatic force:
\[ F_t = -F \sin \beta \approx -\frac{Qq}{4\pi \epsilon_0 a^2} \left( 1 - \frac{a^2 - b^2}{2b^2} \theta^2 \right)^{-2} \cdot \left( \frac{a^2}{b^2} - 1 \right) \theta \]
\[ \approx -\frac{Qq (a^2 - b^2)}{4\pi \epsilon_0 a^2 b^2} \theta \]

Velocity of the small object:
\[ v = \dot{r} + r \dot{\theta} = -\frac{a (a^2 - b^2)}{2b^2} 2 \theta \dot{\theta} + a \left( 1 - \frac{a^2 - b^2}{2b^2} \theta^2 \right) \dot{\theta} \approx a \dot{\theta} \]

\[ F_t = m a_t = m \dot{v} = m a \ddot{\theta} \]

\[ ma \ddot{\theta} = -\frac{Qq (a^2 - b^2)}{4\pi \epsilon_0 a^2 b^2} \theta \]

This is the standard equation of simple harmonic motion, with the angular frequency of motion being:
\[ \omega = \sqrt{\frac{Qq (a^2 - b^2)}{4\pi \epsilon_0 m a^3 b^2}} \]

There is a uniform spring with a spring constant of \(k\) and an original length of \(L\), with a mass of \(m\). One end is connected to a wall, and the other end is connected to a mass \(M\) block, placed on a horizontal smooth surface for simple harmonic motion. It is known that \(m \ll M\).

The spring, after being used for a long time, experiences corrosion, causing the spring constant to decrease and the mass to increase. It is approximately assumed that the spring constant and mass uniformly increase or decrease throughout the spring.

A new spring initially has an amplitude of \(A_0\). After a period of time, the spring mass becomes \(\gamma_1\) times its original mass, and the spring constant becomes \((1 - \gamma_2\frac{m}{M})\) times its original value. Under the following model, find the change in amplitude \(\Delta A\).

Assume that the additional mass added to the spring during corrosion moves at the same speed as the spring, meaning the added mass has the same velocity as the point where it is added.

---","First, based on the analysis of the change in the system's mechanical energy, through the integration of energy relationships and separation of variables, the relationship between the energy ratio and the stiffness coefficient as well as mass is obtained:  
\(\ln\frac{E}{E_0} = \frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{k'}{k} + \frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{M'}{M_0'}\), taking the exponential on both sides gives \(\frac{E}{E_0} = \sqrt{\frac{k'}{k}\frac{M'}{M_0'}}\).  
From \(E = \frac{1}{2}k'A^2\) and \(E_0 = \frac{1}{2}kA_0^2\), it follows that \(\frac{\frac{1}{2}k'A^2}{\frac{1}{2}kA_0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{k'}{k}\frac{M'}{M_0'}}\).  
Substituting \(k' = (1 - \gamma_2\frac{m}{M})k\), \(M' = M + \frac{1}{3}\gamma_1 m\), \(M_0' = M + \frac{1}{3}m\), and approximating using \(m \ll M\):  
\(\frac{A^4}{A_0^4} = \frac{M + \frac{1}{3}\gamma_1 m}{M + \frac{1}{3}m} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \gamma_2\frac{m}{M}} \approx \left(1 + \frac{\gamma_1 - 1}{3}\frac{m}{M}\right)\left(1 + \gamma_2\frac{m}{M}\right) \approx 1 + \left(\frac{\gamma_1 - 1}{3} + \gamma_2\right)\frac{m}{M}\).  
Expanding \(A^4 \approx A_0^4\left[1 + \left(\frac{\gamma_1 - 1}{3} + \gamma_2\right)\frac{m}{M}\right]\) to the fourth root gives \(A \approx A_0\left[1 + \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{\gamma_1 - 1}{3} + \gamma_2\right)\frac{m}{M}\right]\).  
Thus, the change in amplitude \(\Delta A = A - A_0\) is:  
\[
\Delta A = \frac{m A_0}{4M}\left[\frac{1}{3}(\gamma_1 - 1) + \gamma_2\right]

\Delta A = \frac{m A_0}{4M}\left[\frac{1}{3}(\gamma_1 - 1) + \gamma_2\right]

284,OPTICS,"Fiber-optic communication has greatly advanced our information technology development. Below, we will briefly calculate how the light carrying information propagates through a rectangular optical fiber. Consider a two-dimensional waveguide (uniform in the direction perpendicular to the paper), extending along the $x$ direction, with variations in refractive index in the $y$ direction. The middle layer is called the core, with a thickness of $b$ and refractive index $n$; the top and bottom layers are called the cladding, with a refractive index of $n+\delta n$. Assume the light entering the fiber is a monochromatic wave with a wavelength of $\lambda$.

When reflecting at the waveguide interface, the light transitioning from $n_{1}$ to $n_{2}$ has a reflection coefficient:

$$
r={\frac{n_{1}\cos\theta_{1}-n_{2}\cos\theta_{2}}{n_{1}\cos\theta_{1}+n_{2}\cos\theta_{2}}}
$$  

where $\theta_1$ is the angle of incidence and $\theta_2$ is the angle of refraction. According to theoretical calculations, determine the phase shift $\varphi$ of the light after its first reflection, given that the angle of incidence is $\theta$, assuming total internal reflection occurs. Assume the plane wave phase is $\omega t-kx$.","Considering that the optical signal should propagate without loss, the light transmission in the optical fiber should involve total internal reflection at the interface. Assume the incident electric field is represented by ${\widetilde{E}}_{i}$, and the reflected electric field by $\widetilde{E}_{r}$; we have $\widetilde{E_{r}}=r\cdot\widetilde{E_{i}}$. By substituting Snell's law  

$$
n_{1}\sin\theta_{1}=n_{2}\sin\theta_{2}
$$  

into the expression for the reflection coefficient, we obtain:  

$$
r={\frac{n_{1}\cos\theta_{1}-{\sqrt{{n_{2}}^{2}-{n_{1}}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta_{1}}}}{n_{1}\cos\theta_{1}+{\sqrt{{n_{2}}^{2}-{n_{1}}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta_{1}}}}}
$$  

Total internal reflection condition (no loss) requires:  

$$
n_{2}\leqslant n_{1}\sin\theta_{1}
$$  

Thus, the reflection coefficient can be expressed in the form of a complex number:  

$$
r={\frac{n_{1}\cos\theta_{1}-j{\sqrt{{n_{1}}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta_{1}-{n_{2}}^{2}}}}{n_{1}\cos\theta_{1}+j{\sqrt{{n_{1}}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta_{1}-{n_{2}}^{2}}}}}={\frac{{n_{1}}^{2}\cos2\theta+{n_{2}}^{2}}{{n_{1}}^{2}-{n_{2}}^{2}}}-j{\frac{2n_{1}\cos\theta_{1}{\sqrt{{n_{1}}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta_{1}-{n_{2}}^{2}}}}{{n_{1}}^{2}-{n_{2}}^{2}}}

Therefore, the medium sphere is uniformly polarized, and let the polarization intensity inside the sphere be $P$. The polarization surface charge density follows the cosine distribution as below (where $\alpha=0$ corresponds to the direction of the external field $E$):  

$$
\sigma_{p}(\alpha)=P\cos{\alpha}

The total electric field inside the sphere is $E+E^{\prime}$, and according to the polarization law, we have  

$$
P=(\varepsilon_{r}-1)\varepsilon_{0}(E+E^{\prime})=(\varepsilon_{r}-1)\varepsilon_{0}\left(E-\frac{P}{3\varepsilon_{0}}\right)

71,ELECTRICITY,"Given a particle with charge $q$ and mass $m$ moving in an electric field $\pmb{E}=E_{x}\pmb{x}+E_{z}\pmb{z}$ and a magnetic field $\pmb{B}=B\pmb{z}$. The initial conditions are: position $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ and velocity $(v_{\perp}\cos\delta,v_{\perp}\sin\delta,v_{z})$.

We know that a particle in a uniform magnetic field undergoes circular Larmor gyration, and the center of this rotation is called the guiding center. The drift velocity of this guiding center due to the electric field can be expressed using $\pmb{E},\pmb{B}$ and their magnitudes.

Problem: We discuss the case where the magnetic field is uniform, but the electric field is non-uniform. For simplicity, we assume $\pmb{E}$ is in the $\pmb{x}$ direction and varies sinusoidally in the $\pmb{y}$ direction.

$$
\pmb{E} \equiv E_{0}\cos(k y)\hat{\pmb{x}}
$$

In reality, such a charge distribution can occur in a plasma during wave propagation. Find the corresponding guiding center drift velocity. It is known that the electric field is very weak, and the particle's initial position is $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$. Approximate to the lowest order that can distinguish from the uniform electric field case.","This problem has been modified; the original problem had four questions.

If there is an electric field present, we find that the motion of the particle will be a combination of two movements: the normal circular Larmor gyration and a drift towards the center of guidance. We can choose the $\pmb{x}$ axis along the direction of $\pmb{E}$, so $\pmb{E}_{y}=0$, and the velocity components related to transverse components can be treated separately. The equation of motion is  

$$
m{\frac{d v}{d t}}=q({\pmb{E}}+v\times{\pmb{B}})
$$  

Its $\pmb{z}$ component is  

$$
\frac{d v_{z}}{d t}=\frac{q}{m}E_{z}
$$  

Integrating yields  

$$
v_{\tau}=\frac{q E_{z}}{m}t+v_{z0}
$$  

This is a simple motion along the direction of $\pmb{B}$. The transverse components of the previous equation are  

$$
\frac{d\upsilon_{x}}{d t}=\frac{q}{m}E_{x}\pm\omega_{c}\upsilon_{y}
$$  

$$
\frac{d\upsilon_{y}}{d t}=0\pm\omega_{c}\upsilon_{x}
$$  

where $\omega_{c}\equiv{\frac{|g|B}{m}}$ is the Larmor gyration angular frequency. Differentiating these two equations gives  

$$
\ddot{v}_{x}=-\omega_{c}^{2}v_{x}
$$  

$$
\ddot{v}_{y}=-\omega_{c}^{2}(v_{y}+\frac{E_{x}}{B})
$$  

We can rewrite the above equations as  

$$
\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}(v_{y}+\frac{E_{x}}{B})=-\omega_{c}^{2}(v_{y}+\frac{E_{x}}{B})
$$  

Therefore, if we use $\begin{array}{r}{v_{y}+\frac{E_{x}}{B}}\end{array}$ instead of ${\pmb v_{\pmb y}}$, the equation simplifies to the situation when the electric field is zero. Thus, the two equations can be replaced by  

$$
v_{x}=v_{\perp}e^{i(\omega_{\mathrm{e}}t+\delta)}
$$  

$$
\upsilon_{y}=-i\upsilon_{\perp}e^{i(\omega_{c}t+\delta)}-\frac{E_{x}}{B}
$$  

where $\delta$ is the angle between the component of the particle's initial velocity in the $_{xy}$ plane ${\pmb v}_{\bot}$ and the $\pmb{x}$ axis (counter-clockwise direction). Further integration and taking the real part yields the equations of motion  

$$
x=x_{0}+\frac{v_{\perp}}{\omega_{c}}\sin(\omega_{c}t+\delta)
$$  

$$
y=y_{0}-\frac{E_{x}}{B}t+\frac{v_{\perp}}{\omega_{c}}[1-\cos(\omega_{c}t+\delta)]
$$  

$$
z=\frac{q E_{z}}{2m}t^{2}+v_{z0}t+z_{0}
$$  

From the equations of motion, it is observed that the Larmor motion of the particle is identical to the case without an electric field, but there is a drift superimposed in the $-y$ direction towards the center of guidance ${\pmb v}_{{\pmb g}{\pmb c}}$ (for $E_{z}>0)$.

To obtain the general formula for ${\pmb v}_{{\pmb g}{\pmb c}}$, we can solve the equation (1) using vector form. Since we already know that the term $\textstyle m{\frac{d v}{d t}}$ only gives rise to circular motion with frequency $\omega_{c}$, this term can be ignored in equation (1). Thus, equation (1) becomes  

$$
\pmb{{ E}}+\pmb{{\upsilon}}\times\pmb{{ B}}=0
$$  

By taking the cross product of $\pmb{B}$ with the above expression, we get  

$$
\pmb{E}\times\pmb{B}=\pmb{B}\times(\pmb{v}\times\pmb{B})=\pmb{v}\pmb{B}^{2}-\pmb{B}(\pmb{v}\cdot\pmb{B})
$$  

The transverse component of this equation is  

$$
v_{\perp q c}=E\times B/B^{2}\equiv v_{E}
$$  

We define this transverse component as $\pmb{v}_{E}$, which is the electric field drift towards the center of guidance.

The equation of motion for the particle is  

$$
m{\frac{d{\boldsymbol{v}}}{d t}}=q[{\boldsymbol{E}}({\boldsymbol{y}})+{\boldsymbol{v}}\times{\boldsymbol{B}}]
$$  

Decomposing into scalar form, we have  

$$
\dot{v}_{x}=\frac{q B}{m}v_{y}+\frac{q}{m}E_{x}(y)
$$  

$$
\dot{v}_{y}=-\frac{q B}{m}v_{x}
$$  

Simplifying yields  

$$
\ddot{\upsilon}_{x}=-\omega_{c}^{2}\upsilon_{x}\pm\omega_{c}\frac{\dot{E}_{x}(y)}{B}
$$  

$$
\ddot{v}_{y}=-\omega_{c}^{2}v_{y}-\omega_{c}^{2}\frac{E_{x}(y)}{B}
$$  

Here, $\pmb{E_{x}}(\pmb{y})$ is the electric field at the particle's location. To compute this value, we need to know the particle's trajectory, which is precisely what we attempt to solve initially. If the electric field is weak, as a first approximation, we can estimate $E_{x}(y)$ using the undisturbed trajectory.

The trajectory in the absence of an electric field is given by  

$$
y=y_{0}\pm r_{L}\cos\omega_{c}t
$$  

where $\begin{array}{r}{r_{L}=\frac{m v_{\perp}}{|q|B}}\end{array}$ is the Larmor gyration radius, and we obtain  

$$
\ddot{v}_{y}=-\omega_{c}^{2}v_{y}-\omega_{c}^{2}\frac{E_{0}}{B}\cos k(y_{0}\pm r_{L}\cos\omega_{c}t)
$$  

We seek a solution that is the sum of the gyration at $\omega_{c}$ and a stationary drift $_{v_{E}}$. Since we are interested in expressing $v_{E}$, we can average over one cycle to eliminate the gyration motion. Thus, the equation yields  

$$
\bar{v}_{x}=0
$$  

In the above equation, the average of the oscillating term $\ddot{v}_{y}$ is clearly zero, giving us  

$$
\overline{{\ddot{v}}}_{y}=0=-\omega_{c}^{2}\overline{{v}}_{y}-\omega_{c}^{2}\frac{E_{0}}{B}\overline{{\cos k(y_{0}\pm r_{L}\cos\omega_{c}t)}}
$$  

Upon expanding the small approximation and averaging, we find  

$$
\overline{{v}}_{y}=-\frac{E_{x}(y_{0})}{B}(1-\frac{1}{4}k^{2}r_{L}^{2})
$$  

Thus, due to non-uniformity, the usual $\pmb{{E}}\times\pmb{{B}}$ drift is modified to  

$$
\boxed{v_{E}={\frac{E\times B}{B^{2}}}(1-{\frac{1}{4}}{(k \frac{m v_{\perp}}{\vert{q}\vert B})}^2)}
$$  

The correction term represents the finite Larmor radius effect under the sinusoidal electric field distribution.","$$

766,MECHANICS," A small ring $A$ with mass $m$ is placed on a smooth horizontal fixed rod and connected to a small ball $B$ with mass $m$ by a thin string of length $l$. Initially, the string is pulled to a horizontal position, and then the system is released from rest. Find: When the angle between the string and the horizontal rod is $\theta$, what is the tension in the string?
","【Solution】Let the angle between the rope and the rod be $\theta$, the velocity of the small ring A be $\boldsymbol{v}_{A}$, and the velocity of the small ball B relative to the small ring be $v'$. Then the velocity of the small ball B relative to the bottom surface $\boldsymbol{v}_{B}$ is given by the relative motion formula, that is $$ \boldsymbol{v}_{B} = \boldsymbol{v'} +  \boldsymbol{v}_{A} \tag{1} $$  $$ \upsilon_{Br} = \upsilon_{A} - \upsilon^{\prime} \sin\theta \tag{2} $$ $$ \upsilon_{B} = \sqrt{(\upsilon_{A} - \upsilon^{\prime} \sin\theta)^2 + (\upsilon^{\prime} \cos\theta)^2} \tag{3} $$  By horizontal momentum conservation and mechanical energy conservation for the system, we have $$ m \upsilon_{A} + m \upsilon_{Br} = 0 \tag{4} $$ $$ \frac{1}{2} m \upsilon_{A}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m \upsilon_{B}^2 - m g l \sin\theta = 0 \tag{5} $$  Where the zero point of gravitational potential energy is taken at the release point of ball B. Substitute equations (2) and (3) into equations (4) and (5) respectively to obtain $$ m\upsilon_{A}+ m (\upsilon_{A} - \upsilon^{\prime} \sin\theta) = 0 \tag{6}  $$  $$ \frac{1}{2} m \upsilon_{A}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m \left[(\upsilon_{A} - \upsilon^{\prime} \sin\theta)^2 + (\upsilon^{\prime} \cos\theta)^2\right] - m g l \sin\theta = 0 \tag{7} $$  Jointly solving equations (6) and (7), we obtain $$ \upsilon^{\prime 2} = \frac{4g l \sin\theta}{1 + \cos^2\theta} \tag{8} $$ $$ \upsilon_{A} = \frac{1}{2} \sin\theta \sqrt{\frac{4g l \sin\theta}{1 + \cos^2\theta}} \tag{9} $$  Let the angle between $ u_{B}$ and $ u^{\prime}$ be $a$.

716,MECHANICS,"The principle of a rotational speed measurement and control device is as follows. At point O, there is a positive charge with an electric quantity of Q. A lightweight, smooth-walled insulating thin tube can rotate around a vertical axis through point O in the horizontal plane. At a distance L from point O inside the tube, there is a photoelectric trigger control switch A. A lightweight insulating spring with a free length of L/4 is fixed at the O end, and the other end of the spring is connected to a small ball with mass m and positive charge q.  Initially, the system is in static equilibrium. The thin tube rotates about a fixed axis under the action of an external torque, allowing the small ball to move within the thin tube. When the rotational speed $\omega$ of the thin tube gradually increases, the small ball reaches point A in the thin tube and just achieves radial equilibrium relative to the thin tube, triggering the control switch. The external torque instantaneously becomes zero, thus limiting excessive rotational speed; at the same time, the charge at point O becomes an equal amount of negative charge -Q. By measuring the position B of the radial equilibrium point of the small ball relative to the thin tube thereafter, the rotational speed can be determined. If the distance OB is measured to be $L/2$, determine the rotational speed $\omega$ of the thin tube when the ball is at point B.  Express the result using the following physical quantities: Electric charge $Q$, ball's electric charge $q$, mass $m$, length $L$, and Coulomb's constant $k$.
","Let the angular velocity of the thin tube be $\omega_A$. When the small ball is in equilibrium at point A relative to the thin tube, we have:  $$ k_0 \cdot \frac{3}{4}L - \frac{k q Q}{L^2} = m L \omega_A^2 \tag{1} $$  When the small ball is in equilibrium at point B ($OB = L/2$), with angular velocity $\omega_B$, we have:  $$ k_0 \cdot \frac{1}{4}L + \frac{k q Q}{L^2 / 4} = \frac{L}{2} m \omega_B^2 \tag{2} $$  Conservation of angular momentum gives:  $$ m L^2 \omega_A = m \cdot \frac{L^2}{4} \omega_B \tag{3} $$  From this, we obtain:  $$ \omega_B = 4 \omega_A $$  Substituting the above into equation (2):  $$ k_0 \cdot \frac{1}{4}L + \frac{k q Q}{L^2 / 4} = 8 L m \omega_A^2 \tag{4} $$  Simultaneously solving equations (1) and (4), we find the spring constant:  $$ k_0 = \frac{48 k q Q}{23 L^3} \tag{5} $$  Substituting equation (5) into equation (2), we can find the angular velocity of the thin tube at this time:  $$ \omega_B = 4 \sqrt{ \frac{13 k q Q}{23 m L^3} } \tag{6} $$

First, consider $R_{02}$, which is relatively simple. Due to symmetry, the two nodes divide the network into two parts, each side being equivalent to $\scriptstyle{R^{\prime}}$. The self-similarity of $\scriptstyle{R^{\prime}}$ provides the equivalence shown on the right of the diagram above. Therefore, the 35 resistors are also $\scriptstyle{R^{\prime}}$, leading to:

Discarding the negative root gives:

Thus:

The speed of light in a vacuum is $c$, and the reduced Planck constant is $\hbar = h / (2\pi)$.

If a bound pair is stable in the ground state $n=1$, the maximum value of $\alpha$, $\alpha_{c}$, can be calculated.

To bombard $\mathrm{X_{2}}$ and separate $\mathrm{X}$, neglecting the rest mass and utilizing a particle with ultra-high speed and energy $E$, the experimental setup involves bombarding $\mathrm{X_{2}}$ at rest in the laboratory frame $\mathrm{L}$. Set $\alpha = \alpha_{c}/2$.

Consider a droplet of water being flung off the surface of the sphere, and then follows a trajectory under the influence of gravity.

If the angular velocity is too small, water droplets cannot be flung off the top, so there's a minimum angular velocity $\omega_{1}$.

When the angular velocity $\omega>\omega_{1}$, there is still a region on the sphere where droplets cannot be normally flung off. Find the equation of the curve projecting the boundary of this region onto the $xy$-plane (express this as an equation involving $y^2$ in terms of $x$).","Take the $x$-axis as the polar axis, and the $z$-axis as the reference axis for the azimuthal angle, i.e.:

By considering the wave vector continuous along the direction of the scale markings, one can derive the equation of the curve where the diffraction pattern appears (general property); by considering the strong interference between the graduations, one can determine the locations of the primary maxima in the diffraction pattern (specific property).

For simplicity, assume the steel ruler is completely horizontal, setting $\xi=0$. Find: the spacing of the primary maxima near the zeroth-order maximum $\Delta y$.","Let the coordinates of the diffraction point be $(x,y)$, we can derive the incident wave vector and the reflected wave vector  

$$

$$  

The wave vector is continuous along the direction of the scale mark  

$$
({\pmb k}^{\prime}-{\pmb k})\cdot{\widehat{\pmb x}}=0
$$  

This yields  

$$
x=0
$$  

The interference between scales is extremely strong (assume the order is $n$)  

$$
(k^{\prime}-k)\cdot d(\sin\phi\widehat{\pmb{y}}+\cos\phi\widehat{\pmb{z}})=2n\pi
$$  

Solving, we obtain  

$$

The solution for $y$ is  

$$
y_{n}=\frac{\sin\phi\cos\phi+\sqrt{\sin\phi^{2}\cos\phi^{2}-\left[(\frac{n\lambda}{d}+\cos\phi)^{2}-\sin\phi^{2}\right]\left[(\frac{n\lambda}{d})^{2}+2\frac{n\lambda}{d}\cos\phi\right]}}{(\frac{n\lambda}{d}+\cos\phi)^{2}-\sin\phi^{2}}L

498,OPTICS,"The interference phenomenon in variable refractive index systems is a new issue of concern in the field of optics in recent years. There is a thin film of non-dispersive variable refractive index medium with a constant thickness \(d\), where the refractive index within the film changes linearly with the distance from the film's surface. The refractive index at the lower surface is \(n_a\), and at the upper surface is \(n_b > n_a\). A beam of parallel light enters the film from the lower surface at an incident angle \(i\). Taking the incident point as the origin, the positive direction of the \(x\)-axis is along the lower surface of the film to the right, and the positive direction of the \(y\)-axis is perpendicular to the film surface upward.

If the incident light is monochromatic light with wavelength \(\lambda\), and the refractive index of air for this wavelength of light is \(n_0 = 1\), the distance between the incident points of two adjacent beams of incident light is \(2S\). The incident point of the first beam on the lower surface is denoted as Q, and the point from which it exits from the lower surface again after its first reflection from the upper surface is denoted as P, with OP = \(2S\). It is important to note that \(S\) is unknown and can be determined through other physical quantities; the final answer should not contain \(S\). Ignoring the phase change caused by reflection, find the phase difference \(\varphi\) between the two beams of light.","The phase difference is \(\varphi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \Delta L\), where \(\Delta L = L - L_0\).
\(L\) is the total optical path from the incident point Q through reflection to the exit point P in the medium.
\(L_0 = 2S \sin i\) is the optical path difference in air for two adjacent incident beams, which can also be understood as: if the light travels a horizontal distance \(2S\) in air (with a refractive index of 1), it is the projection of the optical path along the direction parallel to the incident light.
This definition of \(\Delta L\) describes the additional optical path difference caused by light traveling in the medium relative to traveling the same equivalent distance in air, which is often used to describe the formation of interference patterns.

1. **Calculate the optical path \(L\) in the medium**:
   We have already calculated:
   \(L = 2 \int_0^d \frac{n(y)^2}{\sqrt{n(y)^2 - \sin^2 i}} dy\)
   Substituting variables \(u = n(y) = n_a + ky\), \(dy = \frac{d}{n_b - n_a} du\).
   \(L = 2 \int_{n_a}^{n_b} \frac{u^2}{\sqrt{u^2 - \sin^2 i}} \frac{d}{n_b - n_a} du = \frac{2d}{n_b - n_a} \int_{n_a}^{n_b} \frac{u^2}{\sqrt{u^2 - \sin^2 i}} du\)
   Using the integration formula \(\int \frac{x^2 dx}{\sqrt{x^2 - A^2}} = \frac{x}{2} \sqrt{x^2 - A^2} + \frac{A^2}{2} \ln|x + \sqrt{x^2 - A^2}| + C\), where \(A = \sin i\).
   \(L = \frac{2d}{n_b - n_a} \left[ \frac{u}{2} \sqrt{u^2 - \sin^2 i} + \frac{\sin^2 i}{2} \ln(u + \sqrt{u^2 - \sin^2 i}) \right]_{n_a}^{n_b}\)
   \(L = \frac{d}{n_b - n_a} \left[ u \sqrt{u^2 - \sin^2 i} + \sin^2 i \ln(u + \sqrt{u^2 - \sin^2 i}) \right]_{n_a}^{n_b}\)
   \(L = \frac{d}{n_b - n_a} \left[ n_b\sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i} - n_a\sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i} + \sin^2 i \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right) \right]\)

2. **Calculate the horizontal displacement \(2S\)**:
   We have already calculated:
   \(2S = 2 \int_0^d \frac{\sin i}{\sqrt{n(y)^2 - \sin^2 i}} dy\)
   \(2S = 2 \sin i \int_0^d \frac{dy}{\sqrt{n(y)^2 - \sin^2 i}}\)
   \(2S = 2 \sin i \left[ \frac{d}{n_b - n_a} \int_{n_a}^{n_b} \frac{du}{\sqrt{u^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right]\)
   \(2S = \frac{2d \sin i}{n_b - n_a} \left[ \ln(u + \sqrt{u^2 - \sin^2 i}) \right]_{n_a}^{n_b}\)
   \(2S = \frac{2d \sin i}{n_b - n_a} \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right)\)

3. **Calculate the optical path difference \(L_0\) in air**:
   \(L_0 = 2S \sin i\)
   \(L_0 = \left[ \frac{2d \sin i}{n_b - n_a} \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right) \right] \sin i\)
   \(L_0 = \frac{2d \sin^2 i}{n_b - n_a} \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right)\)

4. **Calculate the total optical path difference \(\Delta L\)**:
   \(\Delta L = L - L_0\)
   \(\Delta L = \frac{d}{n_b - n_a} \left[ n_b\sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i} - n_a\sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i} + \sin^2 i \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right) \right] - \frac{2d \sin^2 i}{n_b - n_a} \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right)\)
   \(\Delta L = \frac{d}{n_b - n_a} \left[ n_b\sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i} - n_a\sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i} + (\sin^2 i - 2\sin^2 i) \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right) \right]\)
   \(\Delta L = \frac{d}{n_b - n_a} \left[ n_b\sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i} - n_a\sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i} - \sin^2 i \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right) \right]\)

5. **Calculate the phase difference \(\varphi\)**:
   \(\varphi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \Delta L\)
   \[ \varphi = \frac{2\pi d}{\lambda (n_b - n_a)} \left[ n_b\sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i} - n_a\sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i} - \sin^2 i \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right) \right] \]
   Or written in the form of arccosh:
   \[ \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right) = \text{arccosh}\left(\frac{n_b}{\sin i}\right) - \text{arccosh}\left(\frac{n_a}{\sin i}\right) \]
   Therefore:
   \[ \varphi = \frac{2\pi d}{\lambda (n_b - n_a)} \left[ n_b\sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i} - n_a\sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i} - \sin^2 i \left( \text{arccosh}\left(\frac{n_b}{\sin i}\right) - \text{arccosh}\left(\frac{n_a}{\sin i}\right) \right) \right] \]

Final answer:
The phase difference \(\varphi\) between the two beams is:
\[ \varphi = \frac{2\pi d}{\lambda (n_b - n_a)} \left[ n_b\sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i} - n_a\sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i} - \sin^2 i \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right) \right] \]",\[ \varphi = \frac{2\pi d}{\lambda (n_b - n_a)} \left[ n_b\sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i} - n_a\sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i} - \sin^2 i \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right) \right] \]

Due to a very small wavelength difference, the higher-order interference fringes on the screen will become blurred. Neglecting the width of the slits themselves, introduce the contrast function $\gamma \equiv\frac{I_{max}-I_{min}}{I_{max}+I_{min}}$ to measure the clarity of the interference. When $\gamma = 0$, the fringes will become blurred. Additionally, if the background light intensity becomes $1/e$ of the system's maximum possible light intensity, it will also cause the observer to subjectively perceive the interference fringes as too dim, leading to blurriness.  If the width of the double slits is $d$ and the horizontal distance from the screen to the double slits is $L$. Use a filter to filter out the light with a wavelength of $\lambda_{1}$. Due to the broadening of the spectral line caused by the thermal motion of molecules in the sodium lamp, if the temperature of the sodium lamp is $T$ and the mass of the sodium atom is $m$, try to calculate the position where the fringes become blurred for the first time. Assume that the sodium atoms follow the Maxwell velocity distribution law (and that the problem can be solved using the far-field condition).","Examine the effect of monochromatic light on the screen:  $$  U = U_0 \left( e^{i k \cdot \frac{d x}{L}} + 1 \right) $$  The resulting light intensity is:  $$  I = U \cdot U^* = U_0^2 \left(2 + 2\cos\left(k \cdot \frac{d x}{L}\right)\right) = I_0 \left(1 + \cos\left(k \cdot \frac{d x}{L}\right)\right) $$  For Doppler frequency shift due to thermal motion, examine the Doppler effect of electromagnetic waves:  $$  \frac{k}{k_0} = \frac{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}{1 - \beta \cos\theta} \approx 1 + \beta \cos\theta = 1 + \frac{v_x}{c} \quad $$  For particles with horizontal velocity in the interval $v - v + \mathrm{d}v$ (in terms of emitted light intensity), we have:  $$  \frac{\mathrm{d}I}{I_0} = f_x(v) \, \mathrm{d}v \quad $$  For light intensity on the screen:  $$  I  \propto \int f_x(v)\,\mathrm{d}v \cos\frac{k_0 \left(1 + \frac{v_x}{c}\right) d x}{L}\ = \int f_x(v)\,\mathrm{d}v \left( \cos\frac{k_0 d x}{L}\cos\frac{v k_0 d x}{L c}\ - \sin\frac{k_0 d x}{L}\sin\frac{v k_0 d x}{L c} \right) \quad  $$  Notice that the second term is an odd function, and its integral equals 0.

The magnetic moment $\overrightarrow{M}$ of the ions is usually proportional to the spin vector, ${\overrightarrow{M}} = \gamma{\overrightarrow{S}}$, where $\gamma(>0)$ is a constant. The spin-spin interaction between ions $i$ and $j$ is usually the Heisenberg interaction, $-J_{i,j}\vec{S}_{i} \cdot \vec{S}_{j}$. Under a static uniform external magnetic field $\overrightarrow{B}$, the total energy (Hamiltonian) of the system is typically given by $\begin{array}{r}{H = -\sum_{(i,j)}J_{i,j}\vec{S}_{i}\cdot\vec{S}_{j} - }\end{array}$ $\begin{array}{r}{\gamma\overrightarrow{B}\cdot\sum_{i}\overrightarrow{S}_{i}}\end{array}$.

And the rope remains horizontal. The particle moves on a smooth horizontal surface. Initially, the rope is stretched to a length of $a+b$, and then the particle is released. Determine how much time it takes for the particle to return to the original release position.","First consider \( x > a \). At this time, the particle only experiences the elastic force \( -k(x-a) \) in the horizontal direction. According to Newton's second law, the equation of motion for the particle is

$$
m{\ddot{x}} = -k(x-a),
$$

which is the equation of simple harmonic motion. To solve equation (1), make the substitution \(\xi = x - a\), then equation (1) becomes

$$
m\ddot{\xi} = -k\xi.
$$

Further, with the transformation \(\ddot{\xi} = \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}\xi}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\xi}{\mathrm{d}t} \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\xi}\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\xi}{\mathrm{d}t}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\mathrm{d}\dot{\xi}^{2}}{\mathrm{d}\xi}\), equation (2) becomes

$$
\mathrm{d}\dot{\xi}^{2} = -2\omega^{2}\xi\mathrm{d}\xi,
$$

where \(\omega = \sqrt{k/m}\). Integrating the above, and setting the initial conditions \(\xi = \xi_{0}, \dot{\xi} = v_{0} \) at \(t=0\), yields

$$
\dot{\xi}^{2} = v_{0}^{2} - \omega^{2}(\xi^{2} - \xi_{0}^{2}) = (v_{0}^{2} + \omega^{2}\xi_{0}^{2}) - \omega^{2}\xi^{2},
$$

which implies

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}\xi}{\mathrm{d}t} = \pm\sqrt{(v_{0}^{2} + \omega^{2}\xi_{0}^{2}) - \omega^{2}\xi^{2}} = \pm\omega\sqrt{A^{2} - \xi^{2}},
$$

where \({\cal A} = \sqrt{\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{\omega^{2}} + \xi_{0}^{2}}\). Further integration and considering the initial conditions gives

$$
\xi = A\sin(\pm\omega t + \arcsin \frac{\xi_{0}}{A}) = A\cos(\omega t + \alpha),
$$

where \(\alpha = \pm\arcsin{\frac{\xi_{0}}{A}} \mp {\frac{\pi}{2}}\). Thus, the general solution of equation (1) is

$$
x = a + A\cos(\omega t + \alpha).
$$

According to the problem, at \(t=0\), \(x=a+b, \dot{x}=0\). Substituting into equation (3) determines the constants of integration to be \(A=b, \alpha=0\). Substituting back into equation (3), we obtain

$$
x = a + b\cos\omega t.
$$

This shows that the motion of the particle in the domain \(x > a\) is periodic. The time for the particle to move from \(x = a + b\) to \(x = a\) and back is the period, which is

$$
t_{0} = {\frac{1}{2}}\frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}.
$$

When \(x < -a\), the particle experiences an elastic force of \(-k(x+a)\) in the horizontal direction. Note that because \(x < -a\), \( -(x+a) > 0\), so the elastic force points in the positive \(x\) direction, which is consistent with the actual situation. The equation of motion is

$$
m{\ddot{x}} = -k(x+a).
$$

Using a similar method to the above, the general solution of the equation is

$$
x = -a + B\cos(\omega t + \beta),
$$

where \(B, \beta\) are constants of integration. According to analysis in \(\textcircled{2}\), \(\dot{x}|_{x=a} = \dot{x}|_{x=-a}\), we determine \(B=b\). Equation (5) indicates that the motion of the particle in the region \(x < -a\) is also simple harmonic, with the same frequency as in the region \(x > a\). The time for the particle to move from \(x=-a\) to \(x=-(a+b)\) and back is also \(t_{0}\).

In summary, the total time taken for the particle to move from \(x = a + b \) to \(x = a\) and from \(x = -a\) to \(x = -(a + b)\) and back is

$$
t_{1} = 2t_{0} = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}.
$$

The previous discussion also shows that considering just \(x > a\) is sufficient to determine the characteristics of the particle's motion in the interval \(|x| > a\), especially concerning the motion's time.

\(\textcircled{2}\) When \(|x|<a\), i.e., \(-a<x<a\), the particle is not subject to any external force in the horizontal direction, and thus will move uniformly with the velocity it has at \(x = \pm a\). The speed of the particle at \(x = a\) is

$$
\dot{x}|_{x=a} = \dot{x}|_{t=t_{1}} = -b\omega = -b\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
$$

The time for the particle to travel from \(x=a\) to \(x=-a\) and back to \(x=a\) is

$$
t_{2} = 4\frac{a}{|\dot{x}|_{x=a}|} = \frac{4a}{b}\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}.
$$

The process for the particle to return to its release point is \(x = a+b \rightarrow x = a \rightarrow x = 0 \rightarrow x = -a \rightarrow x = -(a+b) \rightarrow x = -a \rightarrow x = 0 \rightarrow x = a \rightarrow x = a+b\), so the total time experienced is

$$
t = t_{1} + t_{2} = 2\left(\pi + \frac{2a}{b}\right)\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}.

401,MECHANICS,"A certain planet has a smooth and elastic surface, perfect for playing bounce games. Let the planet have a radius $R$, and the first cosmic velocity at the surface is $v_{0}$. The ground's restitution coefficient is a fixed value $\varepsilon$. Imagine launching a bouncy ball from the surface at an angle $\theta$ with a speed of $k v_{0}$. The bouncy ball will rotate around the planet's center while continuously bouncing off the surface.

If we take $k<1$ and the launch angle $\theta$ to be a small amount and make reasonable approximations, find the total angle $\varphi$ that the bouncy ball rotates around the planet's center before it stops bouncing on the ground and rolls around the surface.","The two components of the initial throw speed are:

$$
v_{r}=k v_{0}\sin\theta\quad,\quad v_{\theta}=k v_{0}\cos\theta
$$  

Based on the symmetry of the starting and landing points with respect to the major axis of the elliptical orbit, and combining the definition of the restitution coefficient under the conditions of a smooth ground. When the object undergoes the $(m+1)$-th segment of projectile motion, the two velocity components at the surface are generally:

$$
v_{m r}=\varepsilon^{m}k v_{0}\sin\theta\quad,\quad v_{m\theta}=k v_{0}\cos\theta

Using the celestial body's angular momentum formula, we can obtain its semi-latus rectum $p$:

$$
L=m\sqrt{G M p}
$$  

$$
L=m v_{m\theta}R
$$  

Using the mechanical energy formula of the celestial body, we can obtain its orbital semi-major axis $A$:

$$
E=-{\frac{G M m}{2A}}
$$  

$$
E=\frac{1}{2}m\left(v_{m r}^{2}+v_{m\theta}^{2}\right)-\frac{G M m}{R}
$$  

The first cosmic velocity is:

$$
v_{0}={\sqrt{\frac{G M}{R}}}
$$  

Finally, the orbital eccentricity is determined, and the standard equation is written as:

$$
r=\frac{p}{1-e\cos\varphi}\quad,\quad p=(1-e^{2})A
$$  

The reason for choosing the denominator as negative is because we use the highest point of the orbit rather than the periapsis direction as the polar axis direction in polar coordinates. The calculation yields:

$$
r={\frac{k^{2}R\cos^{2}\theta}{1-{\sqrt{(1-k^{2}\cos^{2}\theta)^{2}+\varepsilon^{2m}k^{4}\sin^{2}\theta\cos^{2}\theta}}}}\cos\varphi

$$
\cos\varphi={\frac{1-k^{2}\cos^{2}\theta}{\sqrt{(1-k^{2}\cos^{2}\theta)^{2}+\varepsilon^{2m}k^{4}\sin^{2}\theta\cos^{2}\theta}}}

Thus, the positive and negative acute solutions of $\varphi$ represent the angle turned. Additionally, converting the equation above into arctangent gives the rotation angle for this process:

443,ELECTRICITY,"Surface plasmon polariton (SPP) is a research hotspot in micro-nano optics. It is not difficult to discover through calculations that the interaction between free electrons and photons in the metal-dielectric interface region can form specific electromagnetic modes. The free electron density of the metal we use is denoted as $n$, the electrons are modeled as quasiparticles with an equivalent mass $m$ and charge $-e$. Because under optical conditions, the light frequency $\omega$ is often smaller than the plasma frequency $\omega_{p}=\sqrt{n e^{2}/\varepsilon_{0}m}$, it can be found that the corresponding equivalent relative permittivity of the metal is a negative real number. 

If a plane electromagnetic wave at this frequency, with a relative permittivity $\varepsilon_{1}>1$ for the dielectric, enters the metal (which at this frequency has an equivalent relative permittivity $\varepsilon_{2}<0$) with a wavevector $k_{x}=\alpha$, $k_{y}=-\mathrm{i}\beta$ ($\alpha$ and $\beta$ are real numbers), the electric field lies in the $xy$ plane, and the interface is defined as the $y=0$ plane, with the positive $y$-axis pointing from the dielectric towards the metal, there exists a specific horizontal wavevector $k_{x}$ such that no reflected light is generated. Instead, a unique optical mode satisfying Maxwell’s equations is formed solely by the incident and refracted light—this corresponds to the surface plasmon polariton mode. 

However, in this problem, we need to consider the case where the metal actually has a relative complex permittivity $\widetilde{\varepsilon}_{2}=\varepsilon_{21}+\mathrm{i}\varepsilon_{22}$, where $\varepsilon_{21}<0$ and the imaginary part $\varepsilon_{22}$ is a small quantity. Under these conditions, the surface plasmon polariton mode not only propagates but also attenuates. Please express the wavelength $\lambda$ of the surface plasmon polariton mode in terms of the dielectric relative permittivity $\varepsilon_{1}$, the metal’s relative complex permittivity, and the vacuum wavelength $\lambda_{0}$. Approximate to the lowest order.","The magnetic field strength in the $z$ direction is tangentially continuous:

$$
H_{1z}=H_{2z}=H
$$

According to Maxwell's equations:

$$
\nabla\times\pmb{H}=\varepsilon\frac{\partial\pmb{E}}{\partial t}
$$

Furthermore, since the electric field is tangentially continuous:

$$
E_{1x}=E_{2x}
$$

The relationship obtained is:

$$
\frac{k_{1y}}{\varepsilon_{1}}=\frac{-\mathrm{i}\beta_{1}}{\varepsilon_{1}}=\frac{\mathrm{i}\beta_{2}}{\varepsilon_{2}}=\frac{k_{2y}}{\varepsilon_{2}}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{r}{k_{1}^{2}=\alpha^{2}-\beta_{1}^{2}=\varepsilon_{1}k_{0}^{2}>0}\\ {k_{2}^{2}=\alpha^{2}-\beta_{2}^{2}=\varepsilon_{2}k_{0}^{2}<0}\end{array}
$$

Solving for $k_{1x}=k_{2x}=k_{x}=\alpha$, we find:

$$
k_{x}=\frac{\omega}{c}\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_{1}\varepsilon_{2}}{\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{2}}}
$$

Squaring the above expression and rewriting, we get:

$$
(k_{x1}+\mathrm{i}k_{x2})^{2}=k_{0}^{2}\frac{\varepsilon_{1}(\varepsilon_{21}+\mathrm{i}\varepsilon_{22})}{\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{21}+\mathrm{i}\varepsilon_{22}}\approx k_{0}^{2}\frac{\varepsilon_{1}\varepsilon_{21}}{\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{21}}\left(1+\mathrm{i}\frac{\varepsilon_{22}}{\varepsilon_{21}}\right)\left(1-\mathrm{i}\frac{\varepsilon_{22}}{\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{21}}\right)

115,ADVANCED,"Consider a charged rod undergoing relativistic rotation. Within an infinitely long cylinder with radius $R$, positive charges with number density $n$ and charge $q$ revolve around the axis with a uniform angular velocity of $\omega$ in a relativistic motion. The original reference frame is $S$, and now we switch to a reference frame $S^{\prime}$ that moves parallel to the axis with a velocity $\beta c$ relative to frame $S$. We consider the radiation from the accelerating charges. In the relativistic case, the instantaneous outgoing radiated electromagnetic power of a charge $q$ with arbitrary velocity $\pmb{v}$ and arbitrary acceleration $\pmb{a}$ follows the Larmor formula:  
$$
P={\frac{\gamma^{6}q^{2}}{6\pi\varepsilon_{0}c^{3}}}\left[a^{2}-{\frac{(v\times a)^{2}}{c^{2}}}\right]

where $\gamma=1/\sqrt{1-v^{2}/c^{2}}$. Assume all charge radiation is incoherent. Without using energy or power transformation formulas, calculate directly the radiation power per unit length of the rod in frame $S^{\prime}$ through the charge radiation method. The speed of light in a vacuum is $c$.","Charge and current distribution:

$$
\rho=n q
$$

$$
j_{\theta}=\rho v=\Im\Im q\omega\tau
$$

Note that the above equation is valid only for $r<R$, otherwise it is zero. There is an electric field inside and outside:

There is only a magnetic field inside:

$$
E_{\mathrm{r}}(r)=\int_{0}^{\operatorname*{min}\{r,R\}}\frac{\mathrm{d}\lambda}{2\pi\varepsilon_{0}\tau}\quad,\quad\mathrm{d}\lambda=\rho(r^{\prime})\cdot2\pi r^{\prime}\mathrm{d}\tau^{\prime}
$$

The integration yields the result:

$$
\mathcal{B}_{z}(r)=\int_{r}^{R}\mu_{0}\mathrm{d}i~~~,\mathrm{d}i=j_{\theta}(r^{\prime})\cdot\mathrm{d}r^{\prime}
$$

$$
E_{\mathrm{r}}(r)={\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{{\displaystyle{\frac{n q r}{2\varepsilon_{0}}}}}&{(r<R)}\ {{\displaystyle{\frac{n q R^{2}}{2\varepsilon_{0}r}}}}&{(r>R)}\end{array}\right.}

\mathcal{B}_{z}(r)=\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{\frac{\mu_{0}n q\omega(R^{2}-r^{2})}{2}}&{(r<R)}\ {0}&{(r>R)}\end{array}\right.

In a new frame of reference, the number density scales directly:

$$
n^{\prime}=\frac{n}{\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}}
$$

The radius remains unchanged:

$$
\boldsymbol{r}^{\prime}=\boldsymbol{r}
$$

But velocity acquires a new component:

$$
v_{z}^{\prime}=-\beta c
$$

The original components also change. Since one loop in the original reference frame corresponds to proper time, the angular velocity of the new helical motion becomes:

Thus, the new charge and current distribution is:

$$
v_{\theta}^{\prime}\cdot T^{\prime}=v_{\theta}T
$$

$$
T^{\prime}=\frac{T}{\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}}

$$
\rho^{\prime}=\pi^{\prime}q=\frac{n q}{\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}}

$$

$$
B_{\natural}^{\prime}(r)=\left\{{\begin{array}{l l}{{\frac{\mu_{0}n q\omega r^{2}}{2}}}&{(r<R)}\ {0}&{(r>R)}\end{array}}\right.

However, an axial current is also produced, leading to a surrounding magnetic field, expressed as:

$$
B_{\theta}(r)=\int_{0}^{r}\frac{\mu_{0}\mathrm{d}I}{2\pi r}\quad,\quad\mathrm{d}I=j_{z}^{\prime}(r^{\prime})\cdot2\pi r^{\prime}\mathrm{d}r^{\prime}
$$

The integration yields the result:

$$
B_{\theta}^{\prime}(r)=\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{-\frac{\mu_{0}n q\beta c r}{2\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}}}&{(r<R)}\\ {-\frac{\mu_{0}n q\beta c R^{2}}{2\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}r}}&{(r>R)}\end{array}\right.

493,ELECTRICITY,"There is a uniform rigid current-carrying circular ring with mass $M$ and radius $R$, carrying a current of $I$. At a distance $h$ from the center of the ring, there is a magnetic dipole with a magnetic dipole moment of $m$, which is fixed and cannot rotate. The line connecting the magnetic dipole and the center of the ring is perpendicular to the plane of the ring. The ring can only rotate about a certain diameter axis passing through the center of the ring. Initially, the plane of the ring is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic dipole moment. Now, the ring is slightly rotated by a small angle. Find the period $T_1$ of the simple harmonic vibration of the ring after release (assuming that all parameters satisfy the stable equilibrium condition, and in the initial state, the direction of the magnetic field produced by the current on the ring at the position of the magnetic dipole is the same as that of the magnetic dipole). Given the vacuum permeability is $\mu_0$.","When the ring is rotated by an angle \( \theta \), a cylindrical coordinate system is established, and the coordinates corresponding to the position of \( \vec{m} \) are

\[
\begin{cases} 
\rho = h \sin \theta \\
z = h \cos \theta 
\end{cases}
\]

The magnetic field component \( B_z(0, z) \) is given by

\[
B_z(0, z) = \frac{\mu_0 I R^2}{2(R^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}
\]

The expression for the energy of simple harmonic motion involves the second-order term of \( \theta \), so both \( B_z \) and \( B_\rho \) are retained up to the second-order term in \( \rho \) (where \( B_{\rho,0} \), \( B_{z,1} \), and \( B_{\rho,2} \) are all zero):

\[
\begin{cases} 
B_{z,0} = B_z(0, z) = \frac{\mu_0 I R^2}{2(R^2 + z^2)^{3/2}} \\
B_{\rho,1} = -\frac{\rho}{2} \frac{\mathrm{d}B_z(0, z)}{\mathrm{d}z} = \frac{3 \mu_0 I R^2 z \rho}{4(R^2 + z^2)^{5/2}} \\

\]

Using the small-angle approximation \( \sin \theta \approx \theta \) and \( \cos \theta \approx 1 - \frac{1}{2} \theta^2 \):

\[
\begin{cases} 
B_{z,0} \approx \frac{\mu_0 I R^2}{2(R^2 + h^2)^{3/2}} \left(1 + \frac{3}{2} \frac{h^2 \theta^2}{h^2 + R^2}\right) \\
B_{\rho,1} \approx \frac{3 \mu_0 I R^2 h^2 \theta}{4(R^2 + h^2)^{5/2}} \\
B_{z,2} \approx \frac{3 \mu_0 I R^2 h^2 \theta^2 (R^2 - 4h^2)}{8(R^2 + h^2)^{7/2}}
\end{cases}

The potential energy at the angular displacement \( \theta \) is

\[
W = -\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B} = -m(B_z \cos \theta + B_\rho \sin \theta) = -m(B_{z,0} \cos \theta + B_{z,2} \cos \theta + B_{\rho,1} \sin \theta)

\[
= -m \left[ \frac{\mu_0 I R^2}{2(R^2 + h^2)^{3/2}} \left(1 + \frac{3}{2} \frac{h^2 \theta^2}{h^2 + R^2}\right) \left(1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2}\right) + \frac{3 \mu_0 I R^2 h^2 \theta^2 (R^2 - 4h^2)}{8(R^2 + h^2)^{7/2}} \left(1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2}\right) + \frac{3 \mu_0 I R^2 h^2 \theta^2}{4(R^2 + h^2)^{5/2}} \right]
\]

\[
\approx -\frac{m \mu_0 I R^2}{2(R^2 + h^2)^{3/2}} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\mu_0 m I R^2 (2h^4 + 2R^4 - 11R^2 h^2)}{4(h^2 + R^2)^{7/2}} \theta^2

In the above derivation, all terms higher than the second order in \( \theta \) are neglected.

The rotational kinetic energy of the ring is

69,MECHANICS,"In 2023, the team of astronomers led by Jerome Oros at San Diego State University in the United States released their latest research findings, discovering a new binary star system called ""Kepler-49"". Meanwhile, astronomical observations indicate that nearby planets are influenced by this binary star system, resulting in orbital precession. This problem aims to explain this phenomenon concisely.

""Kepler-49"" is a binary star system mainly composed of two stars (Saka and Juipte) with masses $M_{S}$ and $M_{J}$ (both known). Under the mutual gravitational interaction, they perform stable circular motion around the center of mass. With an angular frequency $\Omega$, the respective motion radii $R_{S}$, $R_{J}$ (unknown quantities) and the distance between them $R_{0}$ (unknown quantity) can be determined. The gravitational constant $G$ is known. 

The rotation center of the two stars is set as the origin of coordinates, and a polar coordinate system is established with the closest point as the radial distance to describe the movement of the planet. Experimental observation shows that the scale of the Saka and Juipte system is much smaller than the distance to the planet (i.e., $R_{0} \ll r$). Meanwhile, during one period of $\Omega$, the planet can be approximately considered as not moving. The modified potential energy $V_{\mathrm{eff}}$ (unknown quantity) of the planet can be determined, retaining the lowest order correction term $\delta V$.

It is known that the energy of the planet is $E < 0$, the orbital angular momentum is $\bar{L}$, and the mass is $m$. Only considering the zeroth-order term $V_{0}$ of the gravitational potential energy, the motion equation of the planet $r(\theta)$ (unknown quantity) can be determined.

Question: Consider now the form of potential energy $V = V_{0} + \delta V$ for the planet. In this case, $\vec{B}$ is no longer conserved. Solve for the orbital precession angle $\Delta{\alpha}$ (express the answer in terms of $M_{J}, M_{S}, G, \Omega, m, L$).

Hint 1: The Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector is introduced in the Kepler problem, and in this problem, it is defined as

$$
\vec{B} = \vec{v} \times \vec{L} - G(M_{J} + M_{S})m\hat{r}.
$$

Consider the planet moving only under the potential energy $V = V_{0}$, and in this case, let $\vec{B}_{0} = \vec{B}$. It can be proved that $\vec{B}_{0}$ is conserved (the proof method is unknown), and the expression for $|\vec{B}_{0}|$ can be determined (unknown quantity).

Hint 2: The precession angle is defined as the rotation angle of the closest point during a single period of the planet. Consider the LRL vector pointing to the closest point, retaining the lowest order term:

$$
\Delta\alpha = \left|\frac{\vec{B}_{0}}{|\vec{B}_{0}|} \times \left(\frac{\vec{B}}{|\vec{B}|} - \frac{\vec{B}_{0}}{|\vec{B}_{0}|}\right)\right| \approx \frac{|\vec{B}_{0} \times \Delta\vec{B}|}{|\vec{B}_{0}|^{2}}.
$$","From  

$$
\frac{G M_{J}M_{S}}{(R_{J}+R_{S})^{2}}=M_{J}R_{J}\Omega^{2}=M_{S}R_{S}\Omega^{2}
$$  

we solve  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{R_{J}=\displaystyle\frac{{M}_{S}}{{ M}_{S}+{ M}_{J}}\left(\frac{{ G}({ M}_{S}+{ M}_{J})}{\Omega^{2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}}}\ {{{}}}\ {{R_{S}=\displaystyle\frac{{ M}_{J}}{{ M}_{S}+{ M}_{J}}\left(\frac{{ G}({ M}_{S}+{ M}_{J})}{\Omega^{2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}}}\end{array}
$$  

Further  

$$
R_{0}=R_{J}+R_{S}=\left({\frac{G(M_{S}+M_{J})}{\Omega^{2}}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
$$  

As stated in the problem, during a single period of rotation of the binary system, it is approximately assumed that the planet's position does not change; at time $t$, the potential energy is  

$$
V=-{\frac{G M_{J}m}{\sqrt{r^{2}+R_{J}^{2}-2r R_{J}\cos\left(\Omega t-\varphi_{0}\right)}}}-{\frac{G M_{S}m}{\sqrt{r^{2}+R_{S}^{2}+2r R_{S}\cos\left(\Omega t-\varphi_{0}\right)}}}
$$  

Expand the gravitational potential in a power series in $\scriptstyle{\frac{R_{0}}{r}}$:  

$$
V=-{\frac{G M_{J}m}{r}}\left(1+\cos\left(\Omega t-\varphi_{0}\right){\frac{R_{J}}{r}}+{\frac{3\cos^{2}\left(\Omega t-\varphi_{0}\right)-1}{2}}{\frac{R_{J}^{2}}{r^{2}}}\right)\ldots
$$  

$$
\ldots-{\frac{G M_{s}m}{r}}\left(1-\cos\left(\Omega t-\varphi_{0}\right){\frac{R_{s}}{r}}+{\frac{3\cos^{2}\left(\Omega t-\varphi_{0}\right)-1}{2}}{\frac{R_{s}^{2}}{r^{2}}}\right)
$$  

Consider the time-averaged result and retain the lowest-order correction term, yielding $V_{\mathbf{eff}}$:  

$$
V_{\mathrm{eff}}={\bar{V}}={\frac{\Omega}{2\pi}}\int_{0}^{\frac{2\pi}{n}}V\mathrm{d}t=V_{0}+\delta V=-{\frac{G(M_{J}+M_{S})m}{r}}-{\frac{G M_{J}M_{S}m}{4(M_{J}+M_{S})}}\cdot{\frac{R_{0}^{2}}{r^{3}}}
$$  

When considering only the zero-order term of the potential energy  

$$
V_{0}(r)=-\frac{G(M_{S}+M_{J})m}{r}
$$  

For $\pmb{E}<\mathbf{0}$, the planet is on an elliptical orbit; provided without proof (to be memorized as fundamental knowledge):  

$$
e=\sqrt{1+\frac{2E L^{2}}{G^{2}(M_{S}+M_{J})^{2}m^{3}}}
$$  

$$
p={\frac{L^{2}}{G(M_{J}+M_{S})m^{2}}}
$$  

As stated in the problem, taking the position near the center as the polar radius, we solve  

$$
r(\theta)=\frac{\frac{L^{2}}{G(M_{J}+M_{S})m^{2}}}{1+\sqrt{1+\frac{2E L^{2}}{G^{2}(M_{S}+M_{J})^{2}m^{3}}}\cos\theta}
$$  

(4)  

Considering the form of the potential energy at this time  

$$
V=V_{0}=-\frac{G(M_{J}+M_{S})m}{r}
$$  

$\vec{B}$ conservation equivalently means it does not change over time. Consider the conservation of angular momentum  

$$
{\frac{\mathrm{d}{\vec{B}}}{\mathrm{d}t}}={\frac{1}{m}}({\vec{F}}\times L)-G(M_{J}+M_{S})m{\dot{\theta}}{\hat{\theta}}={\frac{1}{m}}\cdot{\frac{G(M_{J}+M_{S})m}{r^{2}}}\cdot m r^{2}{\dot{\theta}}{\hat{\theta}}-G(M_{J}+M_{S})m{\dot{\theta}}{\hat{\theta}}=0
$$  

For computational convenience, select the special position where the planet is near the center at $\theta=0$:  

$$
\vec{B}_{0}=\frac{L^{2}(1+e)}{p}-G(M_{J}+M_{S})m\hat{r}=G(M_{J}+M_{S})m\sqrt{1+\frac{2E L^{2}}{G^{2}(M_{S}+M_{J})^{2}m^{3}}}\hat{r}
$$  

where $\hat{r}$ is the direction of the planet near the center.  

(5)  

From the above derivation, we know that in the case where only the zero-order term of the potential energy is considered, $\vec{B}$ is conserved and its direction points to the near-center point. Since $\vec{B}$ reflects information about the orbit's shape and orientation, consider the calculation of $\Delta\vec{B}$ at this time  

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{1}{m}(\vec{F}\times L)-G(M_{J}+M_{S})m\dot{\theta}\hat{\theta}=-\frac{1}{m}\frac{\partial(\delta V)}{\partial r}\hat{r}\times\vec{L}=\frac{3G M_{J}M_{S}m}{4(M_{J}+M_{S})}\cdot\frac{R_{0}^{2}}{r^{2}}\dot{\theta}\hat{\theta}
$$  

Integrate over a single period  

$$
\Delta\vec{B}=\int_{0}^{T}\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}\cdot\mathrm{d}t=\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{3G M_{J}M_{S}m}{4(M_{J}+M_{S})}\cdot\frac{R_{0}^{2}}{r^{2}}\mathrm{d}\theta\hat{\theta}
$$  

For the lowest-order correction term, use the elliptical orbit equation obtained in (3):  

$$
r={\frac{p}{1+e\cos\theta}}
$$  

$$
\Delta\vec{B}=\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{3G M_{J}M_{S}m R_{0}^{2}}{4(M_{J}+M_{S})}\cdot\frac{(1+e\cos\theta)^{2}}{p^{2}}(-\sin\theta\hat{x}+\cos\theta\hat{y})\mathrm{d}\theta=\frac{3G M_{J}M_{S}m R_{0}^{2}}{2(M_{J}+M_{S})}\cdot\frac{e\pi}{p^{2}}\hat{y}
$$

Now, due to the completeness of the circuit, the magnitude of the Ampere force is zero, and we only need to consider torque. Since the magnetic field here is uniform, the problem is to determine the magnetic moment $\mu$.  

We use a fundamental yet concise method to solve this problem: we move to the rest frame of the sphere to analyze the problem, and establish the coordinate system as shown in the figure. In this frame, the magnetic field appears to rotate. It should be noted that the focus here is on solving the current distribution. This change of frame is purely mathematical and does not involve relativistic effects.  

Below, we only consider the variation of the magnetic field in the $\pmb{x}$ direction, denoted as $\dot{B_{x}}$, while the variations in the $y/z$ directions are analyzed analogously. Since the relationships between electromotive force, current, and magnetic moment are linear, superposition can be performed in the end! Here, due to the symmetry introduced by the circuit, the electromotive forces and resistances for the eight mesh loops in the front and back are exactly the same, meaning all the loop equations for each mesh are identical. This results in no current through the cross-shaped wires in the center.   

Only the circular arcs perpendicular to the ${\pmb x}$ direction have current, with the electromotive force given by:

$$
\varepsilon=-\pi R^{2}\dot{B_{x}}
$$  

Thus, the current is:

$$
I={\frac{\varepsilon}{2\pi R\lambda}}
$$  

The $\pmb{\mathscr{x}}$ component of the total magnetic moment is:

$$
\mu_{x}=I S=-\frac{\pi R^{3}}{2\lambda}\dot{B_{x}}
$$  

Therefore, the total magnetic moment is:

$$
\vec{\mu}=-\frac{\pi R^{3}}{2\lambda}\dot{\vec{B}}
$$  

In the rest frame, the magnetic field rotates at an angular velocity of $-\alpha$ (referring to the angular velocity of the sphere's rotation). Hence, $\dot{\vec{B}}=-\vec{\omega}\times\vec{B}$. In the ground frame, we arrive at a remarkably elegant result:

$$
\vec{\mu}=\frac{\pi\mathcal{R}^{3}}{2\lambda}\vec{\omega}\times\vec{B}
$$  

This result is remarkably coincidental and symmetric, allowing us to utilize a simple vector method for mechanical analysis. Following the coordinate system established in the first question:

The theorem of the motion of the center of mass is:

$$
m{\frac{d{\vec{v}}}{d t}}={\vec{f}}
$$  

Rotational motion law:

$$
\frac{2}{5}m R^{2}\frac{d\vec{\omega}}{d t}=R\vec{n}\times\vec{f}+\vec{\mu}\times\vec{B}
$$  

Pure rolling constraint:

$$
\vec{v}+R\vec{\omega}\times\vec{n}=0
$$  

By taking the cross product with $\vec{n}$ on both sides of the rotational motion law, we get:

$$
\frac{2}{5}m R^{2}\frac{d\vec{n}\times\vec{\omega}}{d t}=-R\vec{f}+\frac{\pi R^{3}}{2\lambda}\vec{n}\times\left[\left(\vec{B}\cdot\vec{\omega}\right)\vec{B}-B^{2}\vec{\omega}\right]
$$  

Noting that $\vec{n}\times\vec{B}=0$, the second term on the right-hand side of the above equation is omitted. Substituting the pure rolling constraint yields:

$$
\frac{2}{5}m\frac{d\overrightarrow{v}}{d t}=-\overrightarrow{f}-\frac{\pi R B^{2}}{2\lambda}\overrightarrow{v}
$$  

Combining the theorem of the motion of the center of mass:

Direct integration gives:

$$
\frac{7m}{5}\frac{d\overrightarrow{v}}{d t}=-\frac{\pi R B^{2}}{2\lambda}\overrightarrow{v}
$$  

$$
\vec{v}=\vec{v_{0}}e^{-\frac{5\pi R B^{2}}{14m\lambda}t}
$$  

This result indicates that while the direction of velocity of the sphere does not change, its magnitude continually decreases.","$$

709,MECHANICS,"In a zero-gravity space, there is a ring made of a certain material, with a radius of $R$, density $\rho$, Young's modulus $E$, and a circular cross-section with a radius of $r$ ($r \ll R$). The center of the ring is stationary in a rotating reference frame with an angular velocity $\Omega$, and the normal of the ring is in the same direction as $\Omega$. $\Omega$ is much smaller than the natural frequency of the ring's vibration. A perturbation is applied, causing vibrations on the ring. Considering a standing wave solution of order $m$, it is known that the antinodes of the standing wave will precess. Find the precession angular velocity $\delta\omega$. The positive direction is defined to be the same as $\Omega$.  Ignore motion perpendicular to the plane of the ring; the order $m$ indicates that the displacement has the form of $\cos(m\theta)$ or $\sin(m\theta)$.
","Assume the radial and angular displacements of a particle on the ring are $w, v$, and the kinetic energy, potential energy line density are given as $$ T = \frac{1}{2}\rho S\left((\dot v + \Omega (R + w))^2 + (\dot w - \Omega v)^2\right) $$  $$ V = \frac{E I}{2 R^4}\left(w + \partial_\theta^2w\right)^2 $$  The incompressibility constraint $$ \partial_\theta v + w = 0 $$ Thus, the Lagrangian density is $$ \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}\rho S\left((\dot v + \Omega (R + w))^2 + (\dot w - \Omega v)^2\right) - \frac{E I}{2 R^4}\left(w + \partial_\theta^2w\right)^2 - \lambda (\partial_\theta v + w) $$ Substituting into the Lagrange's equations, we get $$ \begin{cases} \ddot v + 2 \Omega \dot w + \partial_\theta \lambda = 0, \\ \ddot w - 2 \Omega \dot v + \frac{EI}{\rho S R}\left(\partial_\theta^4 + 2\partial_\theta^2 + 1\right)w - \lambda = 0, \\ \partial_\theta v + w = 0 \end{cases} $$ Eliminate variables to obtain $$ \partial_t^2\partial_\theta^2 w - \partial_t^2 w + 4 \Omega \partial_t \partial_\theta w + \frac{EI}{\rho S R}(\partial_\theta^6 + 2\partial_\theta^4 + \partial_\theta^2)w = 0 $$ Substituting the $m$-th order traveling wave solution $w = e^{i(\omega t + m\theta)}$ gives $$ (m^2+1)\omega^2-4m\Omega\omega-\frac{EI}{\rho S R}(m^6-2m^4+m^2)=0 $$ Solving gives $$ \omega = \frac{4m\Omega\pm\sqrt{16m^2\Omega^2+\frac{4EI}{\rho S R}(m^6-2m^4+m^2)}}{2(m^2+1)}=\omega_1 \pm \omega_{0} $$ The precession standing wave solution is $$ w = \cos((\omega_1 + \omega_{0})t+m\theta)+\cos((\omega_1 - \omega_{0})t+m\theta) = 2 \cos(\omega_1 t + m\theta)\cos(\omega_0 t) $$ It can be observed that the wave crest will retreat with a precession angular velocity, according to our sign convention, $$ \delta\omega = - \frac{2}{m^2+1}\Omega $$  Of course, it can also be solved using Newtonian mechanics methods, but it is a bit more tedious.

The scale factor is a state-independent dimensionless constant, and
To determine the entropy change $$S_D-S_A$$ of the D state compared to the A state, two states $$A,D$$ on the $$p-v$$ graph are chosen, knowing that $$p_{A}$$,$$v_{A}$$,$$T_{A}$$,$$p_{D}$$,$$v_{D}$$ and that the entropy change of the D state compared to the A state is $$S_D-S_A$$.
","First of all

$$
\alpha={\frac{1}{v}}\left({\frac{\partial v}{\partial T}}\right)_{p}={\frac{3}{T}}
$$

The equation of state can be obtained

$$
v=T^{3}h(p)
$$

Write the full differential of entropy and utilize Maxwell's relation:

$$
d S={\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}}d T+{\frac{\partial S}{\partial p}}d p
$$

$$
\frac{\partial S}{\partial p}=-\frac{\partial v}{\partial T}=-3T^{2}h
$$

During adiabatic process $$ d S=0$$

$$
{\frac{d p}{d T}}={\frac{\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}}{3T^{2}h}}}
$$

And the adiabatic process is

$$
p v^{2}=T^{6}p h^{2}=C
$$

The logarithmic differentiation yields

$$
\frac{d p}{d T}=-\frac{6p h}{T(h+2p h^{\prime})}
$$

Comparing the two derivatives gives

$$
\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}=-\frac{18T p h^{2}}{h+2p h^{\prime}}}
$$

Due to the properties of full differentiation, the two partial derivatives continue to conform to

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial p}\left(-\frac{18T p h^{2}}{h+2p h^{\prime}}\right)=\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\left(-3T^{2}h\right)
$$

Get the differential equation

$$
\left({\frac{3p h^{2}}{h+2p h^{\prime}}\right)^{\prime}=h
$$

Simplify it like this

$$
h=\left[\frac{3p h^{3}}{(p h^{2})^{\prime}}\right]^{\prime}=-3p h^{3}\cdot\frac{(p h^{2})^{\prime\prime}}{[(p h^{2})^{\prime}]^{2}}}+3\ frac{(p h^{2})^{\prime}h+p h^{2}h^{\prime}}{(p h^{2})^{\prime}}
$$

$$
{\frac{(p h^{2})^{\prime}}{p h^{3}}}\cdot h={\frac{(p h^{2})^{\prime}}{p h^{2}}}=-3{\frac{(p h^{2})^{\prime\prime}}{(p h^{2})^{\prime}}}}}+ 3{\frac{(p h^{2})^{\prime}}{p h^{2}}}}+3{\frac{h^{\prime}}{h}}}
$$

The solution is

$$
(p h^{2})^{-2/3}(p h^{2})^{\prime}=C h=C p^{-1/2}\cdot(p h^{2})^{1/2}
$$

Further moving the right-hand side $(p h^{2})^{1/2}$ to the left-hand side and integrating over $P$ finally yields

$$
h={\frac{1}{C_{1}{\sqrt{p}}({\sqrt{p}}+C_{2})^{3}}}}
$$

And thus the final equation of state

$$
T=C_{1}^{\frac{1}{3}}p^{\frac{1}{6}}(\sqrt{p}+C_{2})v^{\frac{1}{3}}
$$

Since the isobaric heat capacity is  

$$
c_{P}=T{\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}}
$$  

Substituting gives the result  

$$
c_{P}=-{\frac{18T^{2}p h^{2}}{h+2p h^{\prime}}}}={\frac{6T^{2}}{C_{1}({\sqrt{p}}+C_{2})^{2}}}}
$$  

Since  

$$
v=T^{3}\cdot{\frac{1}{C_{1}{\sqrt{p}}({\sqrt{p}}+C_{2})^{3}}}}
$$  

Substituting the relationship yields  

$$
\lambda=6\left(1+{\frac{C_{2}}{\sqrt{p}}}\right)
$$  

In order to make $\lambda$ constant we deduce that  

$$
C_{2}=0
$$  

Thus, only  

Since $$ C_{2}=0 $$ the previous conclusion reduces to  

$$
\lambda=6
$$  

Since $C_{2}=0$ simplifies to

$$
h={\frac{1}{C_{1}p^{2}}}
$$

$$
T^{3}=C_{1}p^{2}v
$$

$$
d S=\frac{6T}{C_{1}p}d T-\frac{3T^{2}}{C_{1}p^{2}}d p
$$

Thus, according to the equation of state

$$
C_{1}=\frac{3T_A^{3}}{p_{A}v_{A}^2}
$$

$$
\left({\frac{T_{D}}{T_{A}}}\right)^{3}=\left({\frac{p_{D}}{p_{A}}}\right)^{2}\left({\frac{v_{D}}}{v_{A}}}\right)
$$

Get

$$
T_{D}=T_{A}\left(\frac{p_D^2v_{D}}{p_A^2v_{A}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
$$

The entropy integral gives

$$
S={\frac{3T^{2}}{C_{1}p}}+C^{\prime}=3{\sqrt{\frac{T v}{C_{1}}}}+C^{\prime}
$$

Since the third law of thermodynamics

$$
C^{\prime}=0\quad,\quad S=\frac{3T^{2}}{C_{1}p}
$$

Thus entropy changes

$$
S_{D}-S_{A}={\frac{3T_{D}^{2}}{C_{1}p_{D}}}-{\frac{3T_{A}^{2}}{C_{1}p_{A}}}=\frac{3p_Av_A}{T_A}\left(\left(\frac{p_Dv_D^2}{p_Av_A^ 2}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}-1\right)

The lower surface of the piston is parallel to the bottom surface of the container. The exterior of the container is a vacuum, and the interior contains a diatomic ideal gas with the mass of a single molecule being $m$ and the total number of molecules $N$. The temperature of the gas throughout the container is uniform at $T_{0}$. 

Slowly sprinkle a total mass of powder $(p_{1}-p_{0})S/g$ onto the piston. Neglect all friction, and consider the effect of gravity on the distribution of gas molecules. Find the final temperature of the gas inside the container, $T_{1}$.","In equilibrium in a gravitational field, the molecular number density at temperature $T$ follows the Boltzmann distribution:

$$
n(z) = n_{0} \exp\left(-\frac{m g z}{k T}\right)
$$

In the formula, $n_{0}$ is the molecular number density at $z=0$ (the bottom of the container), which is an unknown to be determined; $k$ is the Boltzmann constant. The total number of molecules in the container remains constant, always equal to $N$:

$$
N = \int_{0}^{H} S n(z) \operatorname{d}z = S n_{0} \int_{0}^{H} \exp\left(-\frac{m g z}{k T}\right) \operatorname{d}z = \frac{S n_{0} k T}{m g} \left[1 - \exp\left(-\frac{m g H}{k T}\right)\right]
$$

Since the system is adiabatic and the powder is spread slowly, it can be assumed that the gas inside the container undergoes a quasi-static adiabatic process. At any moment during the process, let the temperature of the gas inside the container be $T$, the pressure at the lower surface of the piston inside the container be $p$, and the height from the lower surface of the piston to the bottom of the container be $H$. According to the first law of thermodynamics, for the gas inside the container, we have

$$
-p S \mathrm{d}H = \frac{5}{2}N k \mathrm{d}T + \mathrm{d}E_{p}
$$

In this formula, $\frac{5}{2}N k \mathrm{d}T$ represents the increase in internal energy of a diatomic ideal gas, and $\mathrm{d}E_{p}$ is the increase in gravitational potential energy of the gas in the container. Taking $z=0$ as the zero point of gravitational potential energy, we have

$$

$$

At the lower surface of the piston, according to the ideal gas pressure formula, we have

$$
p = n(H) \cdot k T = n_{0} \exp\left(-\frac{m g H}{k T}\right) k T
$$

Substituting into equation $\textcircled{4}$ gives

$$
E_{p} = -p S H + (p S + N m g) \frac{k T}{m g} - p S \frac{k T}{m g} = -p S H + N k T

Here, $p + \frac{N m g}{S} = n_{0} k T$ is the pressure at the bottom of the container. Taking the differential of the above equation gives $\mathrm{d}E_{p} = -p S \mathrm{d}H - S H \mathrm{d}p + N k \mathrm{d}T$, substituting into equation $\textcircled{3}$ gives

$$
S H \mathrm{d}p = \frac{7}{2} N k \mathrm{d}T

Combining equations $\textcircled{2}$ and $\textcircled{5}$ gives

$$
H = \frac{k T}{m g} \ln\frac{p S + N m g}{p S}

Let us first consider the translation of a fixed rectangular shape with ${\Delta p,\Delta V=W/\Delta p}$ in the $\mathcal{P}V$ diagram.

121,MODERN,"Two spacecraft are traveling in a space medium that is flowing uniformly at a constant velocity $u$ with respect to an inertial frame $S$. The spacecraft are moving through the medium with equal relative velocities $v$ with respect to the medium. Neither of the velocities is known. Ultimately, the velocities of the two spacecraft with respect to the inertial frame $S$ are $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$, and the angle between the directions of these velocities is an acute angle $\alpha$. These three quantities are given. The speed of light is $c$. Considering relativistic effects, determine the minimum possible value of $u$.","First, let's derive a byproduct of velocity transformation. The velocity transformation is:

$$
 v_{x}^{\prime}={\frac{v_{x}-u}{1-u v_{x}/c^{2}}}
$$

$$
v_{y,z}^{\prime}=v_{y,z}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{1-u^{2}/c^{2}}}{1-u v_{x}/c^{2}}

Hence, we can calculate:

$$
  \begin{array}{l}{\gamma=\cfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-(v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}+v_{z}^{2})/c^{2}}}}\ {=\cfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-(v_{x}^{\prime2}+v_{y}^{\prime2}+v_{z}^{\prime2})/c^{2}}}}\end{array}
$$

Obtain the transformation:

$$
  \gamma^{\prime}=\gamma\cdot\frac{1-{u v_{x}}/{c^{2}}}{\sqrt{1-{u^{2}}/{c^{2}}}}
$$

The minimum value of $v$ can be calculated by first determining the relative velocity of two planes:

$$
  \gamma_{12}=\frac{1-\beta_{1}\beta_{2}\cos\alpha}{\sqrt{(1-\beta_{1}^{2})(1-\beta_{2}^{2})}}
$$

Consider a system where two spaceships have equal but opposite velocities, this velocity $v=\beta c$ is what we seek. At this moment, the relative velocity of the two planes can be obtained:

Thus, jointly obtain:

$$
  \gamma_{12}=\frac{1+\beta^{2}}{\sqrt{(1-\beta^{2})(1-\beta^{2})}}=\frac{1+\beta^{2}}{1-\beta^{2}}
$$

$$
v=c{\sqrt{\frac{c^{2}-v_{1}v_{2}\cos\alpha-{\sqrt{(c^{2}-v_{1}^{2})(c^{2}-v_{2}^{2})}}}{c^{2}-v_{1}v_{2}\cos\alpha+{\sqrt{(c^{2}-v_{1}^{2})(c^{2}-v_{2}^{2})}}}}}
$$

The minimum value of $u=\beta_{\mathsf{u}}c$ can be set such that its magnitude and direction in the original reference system are between angles $\varphi_{1},\varphi_{2}$ of both velocities. Therefore, after transformation, shared velocity:

$$
  =\gamma_{i}\frac{1-\beta_{u}\beta_{\mathrm{{i}c o s\varphi_{i}}}}{\sqrt{1-\beta_{u}^{2}}}
$$

$$
\gamma_{1}^{\prime}=\gamma_{2}^{\prime}
$$

Obtain velocity:

$$
  \beta_{u}=\frac{\gamma_{1}-\gamma_{2}}{\gamma_{1}\beta_{1}\cos\varphi_{1}-\gamma_{2}\beta_{2}\cos\varphi_{2}}

The denominator can be expanded using the auxiliary angle formula to find extremes:

$$

648,MECHANICS,"In a vacuum, there are concentric spherical shells made of insulating material with radii $R$ and $2R$. The inner shell is uniformly charged with a total charge of $Q(Q>0)$, while the outer shell is uncharged. There is also a small insulating sphere with a charge of $+q(q>0)$ and a mass $m$, which can be launched from a point on the inner shell with a certain velocity. The direction can be adjusted, and its motion is confined between the inner and outer shells. Collisions with the inner and outer shells are perfectly elastic, and the charges do not change during collisions. It is known that the sphere can return to its starting point after making one full orbit around the center. If the sphere is launched from point $A$ on the inner shell and it collides with the inner shell a total of $n$ times (counting the final return to the starting point as one collision), determine the minimum launch speed $v$, ignoring gravity.
","Let the distance from the center of the sphere to the position of the ball at the extreme point be $r_{1}$, and the speed be $ u_{\mathrm{_I}}$. According to the conservation of angular momentum and energy: $$ m u_{0}R\sin\theta = m u_{1}r_{1} = L $$ $$ {\frac{1}{2}}{m{ u_{0}}^{2}}+{\frac{k Q q}{R}} = {\frac{1}{2}}{m{ u_{1}}^{2}}+{\frac{k Q q}{r_{1}}} = E = {\frac{k Q q}{2a}} $$ In an appropriate polar coordinate system, we have: $$ p = \frac{L^{2}}{kQq m}, \quad e = \sqrt{1+\frac{2E}{m}\frac{L^{2}}{k^{2}{Q}^{2}q^{2}}} $$ When $Q>0$, the charged ball undergoes hyperbolic motion. Each time it collides with the inner sphere shell, it also collides with the outer sphere shell, and returns to point $A$. The angular displacement around the center during inner and outer sphere collisions is: $$ \alpha = {\frac{2\pi}{2n}} = {\frac{\pi}{n}} $$ The curve $AB$ is its trajectory, with point $O$ as one focus of the hyperbola, and $C$ as the other focus. According to conic section knowledge, the trajectory of the hyperbola to focus $O$ is: $$ r = \frac{p}{e\cos\theta^{\prime}-1} $$ where $\theta^{\prime}$ is the angle between the trajectory of the ball and its polar axis. Considering that: $$ 2a = {\overline{{A O}}} - {\overline{{A C}}} = R - {\overline{{A C}}} = {\overline{{B O}}} - {\overline{{B C}}} = 2R - {\overline{{B C}}} $$ $$ {\overline{B C}} - {\overline{{A C}}} = R $$ Thus the possible trajectory of point $C$ is a hyperbola, and since $r$ continuously increases from $A$ to $\boldsymbol{B}$, the polar axis of the hyperbola must not pass through the trajectory $AB$. To minimize the launch speed $ u_{0}$, and thus minimize energy $E$, $2a$ should be maximized, making $AC$ minimal, satisfying the condition when focus $C$ is at the extended line $OA$ and intersects the asymptote of the hyperbola at point $D$. At this point: $$ \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} $$ The speed is minimal, and according to geometric relations: $$ a+c = R $$ Additionally, according to previous equations: $$ \theta^{\prime} = 0,\quad r = {\frac{p}{e\cos0-1}} = R $$ $$ \begin{array}{c c}{{\theta^{\prime}=\alpha,}}&{{r=\displaystyle\frac{p}{e\cos{\alpha}-1}}=2R} {{}}&{{}} \end{array} $$ $$ {{\displaystyle a=\frac{2\cos{\alpha}-1}{2\cos{\alpha}}R}} $$ Substituting into previous equations: $$  u_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{2k Q q}{m R}\frac{1-\cos\frac{\pi}{n}}{2\cos\frac{\pi}{n}-1}} $$

From the first law of thermodynamics:

$$
\mathrm{d}U_{i}=T_{i}\mathrm{d}S_{i}-p_{i}\mathrm{d}V_{i}
$$  

And the equation of state:

$$
U_{i}=\frac{3}{2}\nu_{i}R T_{i}=\frac{3}{2}p_{i}V_{i}

To solve these two differential equations, we note that due to energy conservation, the total internal energy remains unchanged:

$$
U_{1}+U_{2}={\frac{3}{2}}\left(p_{1}V_{1}+p_{2}V_{2}\right)={\frac{9}{2}}p_{0}V_{0}

Thus, for the above two equations, we define:

$$
V_{1}=(1+x)V_{0}\quad,\quad V_{2}=(1-x)V_{0}

Simplifying the first equation:

$$
\frac{4}{3}p_{1}V_{2}\mathrm{d}V_{1}+\frac{1}{3}p_{1}V_{1}\mathrm{d}V_{2}+V_{1}V_{2}\mathrm{d}p_{1}=p_{0}V_{0}\mathrm{d}V_{2}

Multiplying both sides by $V_{1}^{1/3}V_{2}^{-2/3}$, the left side conveniently forms a total differential:

Due to conservation of internal energy, the pressure at final equilibrium is equal on both sides:

$$
p\cdot2V_{0}=3p_{0}V_{0}\quad,\quad p={\frac{3}{2}}p_{0}

The ring is a superconducting ring with a self-inductance coefficient $L$.","If the ring is a superconducting ring, when it moves in a magnetic field, due to the properties of the superconductor, the magnetic flux in the ring remains unchanged, i.e.:  $$ L I + B S = B \cdot \pi r^2 $$  Thus, the current in the ring is:  $$ \begin{array}{l}{I = \displaystyle\frac{B}{L}(\pi r^{2} - S)}\ = \displaystyle\frac{B}{L}\left\{r^{2}\arcsin\left[\frac{a(\theta_{0}-\theta)}{r}\right] - \sqrt{2r a\theta-a^{2}\theta^{2}} \cdot a(\theta_{0}-\theta)\right\}\end{array} $$  $$ \phi = \operatorname{arccos}\left[\frac{a(\theta_{0}-\theta)}{r}\right] $$  We have:  $$ \cos\phi = \frac{a(\theta_{0}-\theta)}{r}, \sin\phi = \sqrt{1-\cos^{2}\phi} = \sqrt{1-\frac{a^{2}(\theta_{0}-\theta)^{2}}{r^{2}}} $$  Thus:  $$ I = \frac{B}{L}(r^{2}\phi - r^{2}\sin\phi\cos\phi), l = 2r\sin\phi $$  The torque about the suspension point due to the Ampère force acting on the part of the ring within the magnetic field is approximately:  $$ \tau = I B l a = \frac{2B^{2}r a}{L}(r^{2}\phi - r^{2}\sin\phi\cos\phi)\sin\phi $$  The dynamic equation of the ring is:  $$ m a^{2}\frac{d\omega}{dt} = -\frac{2B^{2}r a}{L}(r^{2}\phi - r^{2}\sin\phi\cos\phi)\sin\phi $$  Since $\frac{d\omega}{dt} = \omega\frac{d\omega}{d\theta}$, we have:  $$ d\theta = \frac{r}{a} \sin (\phi) d\phi $$  Thus:  Integrating both sides, given that initially when $\theta = 0$, $\phi = 0$, and $\omega \approx \frac{v_{0}}{a}$, we have:  $$ m a^{2}\int_{\frac{v_{0}}{a}}^{\omega}\omega d\omega = -\frac{2B^{2}r^{4}}{L}\int_{0}^{\phi}\left(\phi - \sin\phi\cos\phi\right)\sin^{2}\phi d\phi $$  We obtain:  $$ \frac{1}{2}m a^{2}\left(\omega^{2}-\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{a^{2}}\right) = -\frac{B^{2}r^{4}}{2L}\left[\phi^{2} - \phi\sin2\phi - \frac{1}{2}(\cos2\phi - 1) - \sin^{4}\phi\right] $$  Thus:  $$ \omega^{2} = \frac{v_{0}^{2}}{a^{2}} - \frac{B^{2}r^{4}}{m a^{2}L}\left[\phi^{2} - \phi\sin2\phi - \frac{1}{2}(\cos2\phi - 1) - \sin^{4}\phi\right] $$  When the ring has just completely left the magnetic field area, $\theta = 2\theta_{0}$, corresponding to $\phi = \pi$, substituting into the above equation, we get:  $$ \omega_{2}^{2} = \frac{v_{0}^{2}}{a^{2}} - \frac{\pi^{2}B^{2}r^{4}}{m a^{2}L} $$  To make the pendulum reach the horizontal direction, it should satisfy:  $$ v_{0} = \sqrt{2g a + \frac{\pi^{2}B^{2}r^{4}}{m L}} $$",$$\sqrt{2g a+\frac{\pi^2 B^2 r^4}{m L}}$$

Assume the relationship between the atmospheric mass density and the height $h$ above the surface of Mars is given by  $$ \alpha(h)=\rho_{\mathrm{o}}(1+\frac{h}{R_{m}})^{1-n} $$  where $\rho_{\mathrm{0}}$ is a constant, and $\textit{n}(n>4)$ is also a constant.

Express the result using the following physical quantities: the mass of Mars $M_{m}$, radius $R_{m}$, molar mass of the atmosphere $\mu$, constant $n$, gravitational constant $G$, and ideal gas constant $R$.","(1) Basic Assumptions and Ideal Gas Law  In the atmosphere at a certain height \( h \) on Mars, a thin horizontally placed box-shaped region is defined. The volume of this region is \( V \), the mass of the atmosphere inside is \( M \), the pressure is \( P(h) \), and the temperature is \( T(h) \). Because the box is very thin, the density, pressure, and temperature of the gas can be considered constant.  According to the ideal gas law:  $$ P(h)V = n R T(h)  $$  The volume of the atmosphere inside the box is:  $$ V = \frac{M}{\rho(h)}  $$  The number of moles of the Mars atmosphere inside the box is:  $$ n = \frac{M}{\mu}  $$  By combining equations (1), (2), and (3), we get:  $$ T(h) = \frac{P(h) \mu}{\rho(h) R}  $$  (2) Determine the Pressure \( P(h) \)  Consider a thin spherical cap-shaped atmospheric layer from height \( x \) to \( x + dx \), subtending a solid angle \( \Delta \Omega \). Let \( \Delta \Omega \) be very small, so that the radial lines on the side of the spherical cap can be considered parallel to each other.  From the force analysis, we know:  $$ [P(x + dx) - P(x)] \cdot \Delta \Omega (R_m + x)^2 + \rho(x) g(x) \cdot \Delta \Omega (R_m + x)^2 dx = 0 $$  That is:  $$ \frac{dP}{dx} = - \rho(x) g(x)  $$  Where the gravitational acceleration from the surface of Mars to height \( x \) is:  $$ g(x) = \frac{G M_m}{(R_m + x)^2} $$  Substituting into equation (6) and integrating, we obtain:  $$ P(h) = G M_m \int_h^{\infty} \frac{\rho(x)}{(R_m + x)^2} dx  $$  (3) Substitute and Determine the Temperature Expression  Substitute equation (7′) into equation (4), and use the density distribution expression provided in the problem:  $$ \rho(x) = \rho_0 \left(1 + \frac{x}{R_m}\right)^{1 - n} $$  Finally, we get:  $$ T(h) = \frac{\mu G M_m}{n R (R_m + h)}  $$  Final Result (Temperature Distribution of Martian Atmosphere)  $$ \boxed{T(h) = \frac{\mu G M_m}{n R (R_m + h)}} $$  This result indicates that the temperature of Mars' atmosphere decreases inversely with height \( h \).",$$T(h) = \frac{\mu G M_m}{n R (R_m + h)}$$
211,MODERN,"In the ground frame S, two trains with an intrinsic length of $L_{0}$ are stationary along the $x$ axis, with the left side of train A located at $x=0$. The gap between the left side of train B and the right side of train A is $D$. At time $t=0$ in the ground frame S, both trains A and B synchronize their carriage times to $t_{A}=t_{B}=0$, and the clocks are located on the left side of each train. At this moment, the two trains start moving with constant accelerations relative to themselves, $a_{A}$ and $a_{B}$.

Let the distance between train carriages AB in frame S be $D(t)$. Express the value of $a_{B}$ when $D(t)\equiv D$ in terms of $L_{0}$, $a_{A}$, and the speed of light $c$.","Since the left end of the train is aligned with the ground clock, the left end of the train can be regarded as a point mass, and thus we can study uniform accelerated motion.

Let the velocity of the left end at time $t$ in the ground frame be $v(t)$, at time $t+d t$, first perform a Lorentz transformation to the rest frame with velocity $v(t)$. In the rest frame, obtain an infinitesimal velocity $adτ$:

Using the proper time formula:

$$
v+dv={\frac{v+adτ}{1+{\frac{v\times adτ}{c^{2}}}}}\rightarrow dv=adτ\left(1-{\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}\right)
$$

$$
dτ={\sqrt{1-{\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}dt \to dv=a{\sqrt{1-{\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}^{3}}}dt
$$ 

Separate variables on both sides, yielding:

$$
at=\int_{0}^{v}{\frac{dV}{1-{V}^{2}/{c}^{2}}}={\frac{v}{1-{v}^{2}/{c}^{2}}}
$$

Solving for the velocity function:

$$
v(t)={\frac{at}{\sqrt{1+\left({\frac{at}{c}}\right)^{2}}}}\to x(t)=x_{0}+\int_{0}^{t}v(t)dt=x_{0}+{\frac{c^{2}}{a}}\left({\sqrt{1+\left({\frac{at}{c}}\right)^{2}}}-1\right)
$$

Select special cases A, B to write the displacement function:

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l}{\displaystyle x_{l A}=\frac{c^{2}}{a_{A}}\left(\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{a_{A}t}{c}\right)^{2}}-1\right)}\ {\displaystyle x_{l B}=L_{0}+D+\frac{c^{2}}{a_{B}}\left(\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{a_{B}t}{c}\right)^{2}}-1\right)}\end{array}\right.
$$

Using the motion on the left side, we can calculate the proper time:

$$
τ=\int_{0}^{t}{\sqrt{1-\left({\frac{v}{c}}\right)^{2}}}dt=\int_{0}^{t}{\frac{dt}{\sqrt{1+\left({\frac{at}{c}}\right)^{2}}}}={\frac{c}{a}}\mathrm{arcsinh}{\frac{at}{c}}
$$

Apply to special cases A, B:

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{{\displaystyleτ_{A}=\frac{c}{a_{A}}\mathrm{arcsinh}\frac{a_{A}t}{c}}}\ {{\displaystyleτ_{B}=\frac{c}{a_{B}}\mathrm{arcsinh}\frac{a_{B}t}{c}}}\end{array}\right.
$$

Taking train A as an example, given the proper time $τ_{A}$, the speed of A at this time is:

$$
v_{A}(τ)={\frac{a_{A}t}{\sqrt{1+\left({\frac{a_{A}t}{c}}\right)^{2}}}}=c\operatorname{tanh}{\frac{a_{A}τ}{c}}
$$

The left side of the train system $(0,τ)$ and the ground frame $(x_{l A},t)$ are aligned, allowing for easy writing of the Lorentz transformation for the right end time and coordinates in the ground frame:

$$
t_{r,A}=t+{\frac{v_{A}L_{0}/c^{2}}{1-v_{A}^{2}/c^{2}}}=t+\cosh{\frac{a_{A}τ}{c}}\left({\frac{L_{0}}{c}}\operatorname{tanh}{\frac{a_{A}τ}{c}}\right)=t+{\frac{L_{0}}{c}}\sinh{\frac{a_{A}τ}{c}}=\left(1+{\frac{a_{A}L_{0}}{c^{2}}}\right)t
$$

$$
x_{r,A}=x_{l,A}+\frac{L_{0}}{1-v_{A}^{2}/c^{2}}=\left(\frac{c^{2}}{a_{A}}+L_{0}\right)\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{a_{A}t}{c}\right)^{2}}-\frac{c^{2}}{a_{A}}
$$

Since $x_{r,A}$ occurs at event S frame $t=t_{r,A}$, the correct $x_{r,A}(t)$ function should replace $t$:

$$
x_{r,A}={\frac{c^{2}}{{\frac{a_{A}}{1+{\frac{a_{A}L_{0}}{c^{2}}}}}}}{\sqrt{1+\left({\frac{a_{A}t/c}{1+{\frac{a_{A}L_{0}}{c^{2}}}}}\right)^{2}}}-{\frac{c^{2}}{a_{A}}
$$

At this moment, the distance between the right side of A and the left side of B is:

$$
=x_{l,B}-x_{r,A}=L_{0}+D+{\frac{c^{2}}{a_{B}}}\left(\sqrt{1+\left({\frac{a_{B}t}{c}}\right)^{2}}-1\right)+{\frac{c^{2}}{a_{A}}}-{\frac{c^{2}}{{\frac{a_{A}}{1+{\frac{a_{A}L_{0}}{c^{2}}}}}}}\sqrt{1+\left({\frac{a_{A}t/c}{1+{\frac{a_{A}L_{0}}{c^{2}}}}}\right)^{2}}
$$

If the distance is constant, then naturally:

$$
a_{B}={\frac{a_{A}}{1+{\frac{a_{A}L_{0}}{c^{2}}}}}
$$","$$

The upper ends are also connected by a very short flexible string (with negligible length). The other end of each rod is free to slide across a horizontal table without friction. The plane formed by the rods and strings is perpendicular to the tabletop, with gravitational acceleration $g$. Initially, the rods are stationary, forming an angle $\theta_{0}$ with the tabletop. When the thin string at the center is cut, the rods fall vertically until they hit the table. What is the velocity $v$ of the rods just before the ends connected at the table touch the tabletop?","Solution: Using the conservation of energy:
Initial mechanical energy: $\frac{1}{2}mgl\sin\theta_{0}$

58,ELECTRICITY,"An arbitrary multi-terminal resistor network structure, for example with $N+1$ terminals, sets one specific terminal (0 terminal) as the reference for electric potential, setting its potential at 0. The potentials for other terminals (numbered 1, 2, ..., N) are $v_{1}, v_{2}, \ldots, v_{N}$, and the current flowing into the network through these corresponding terminals (negative when flowing out) are $I_{1}, I_2, \ldots, I_n$. Therefore, we have:

$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
V_{1} = a_{11} I_{1} + a_{12} I_{2} + \cdots + a_{1N} I_{N} \\

Due to symmetry, we know that $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$.

This means that the properties of the $N+1$ terminal network can be determined by $\frac{N(N+1)}{2}$ independent parameters: $a_{11}, a_{12}, \ldots , a_{ij}, \ldots , a_{NN} (i<j)$. These parameters are only determined by the resistor network itself and are unrelated to the potential at the terminals or the magnitude of the current flowing in.

Consider a square uniform conductive thin plate as a four-terminal resistor network. The four vertices are sequentially numbered clockwise as 0, 1, 2, 3. If the equivalent resistance between adjacent vertices is ${R}_{1}$ and the equivalent resistance between opposite vertices is ${{R}}_{2}$, use the method of finding the coefficients $a_{i j} (i,j=1,2,3)$ to solve: what is the equivalent resistance between the other two vertices if a pair of adjacent vertices is short-circuited?","For this situation, label the 4 endpoints sequentially as 0, 1, 2, 3. If current flows into endpoint 1 with current I (flowing out from endpoint 0), then:   

$$
V_{1}=a_{11}I=I R_{1}
$$  

Thus, we obtain: $a_{11}=R_{1}$  

Similarly, if current flows into endpoints 2 or 3 with current I, we can respectively obtain: $a_{22}=R_{2}$ $a_{33}=R_{1}$. If current flows into endpoint 1 with current I and flows out from endpoint 2:  

$$
V_{1}^{\prime}=a_{11}I-a_{12}I,V_{2}^{\prime}=a_{21}I-a_{22}I
$$  

At this moment, the potential difference between endpoints 1 and 2 is:  

$$
V_{1}^{\prime}-V_{2}^{\prime}=(a_{11}-2a_{12}+a_{22})I
$$  

Due to symmetry, at this moment, the potential difference between endpoints 1 and 2 should be equal to the potential at endpoint 1 (between 1 and 0) when current flows only into endpoint 1 (out from endpoint 0), thus:  

$$
(a_{11}-2a_{12}+a_{22})I=a_{11}I
$$  

We obtain:  

$$
a_{12}=\frac{1}{2}a_{22}=\frac{1}{2}R_{2}
$$  

[This can also be directly obtained by the condition of current input into endpoint 2, where the potential at endpoint 1 is half of that at endpoint 2 due to symmetry.] Similarly, we obtain:  

$$
a_{23}=\frac{1}{2}R_{2}
$$  

Returning again to the situation with current flowing only into endpoint 1 (flowing out from endpoint 0), at this moment, the potentials at endpoints 2 and 3 are respectively:  

$$
V_{2}=a_{21}I,V_{3}=a_{31}I
$$  

Due to symmetry, the potential difference between endpoints 1 and 2 should be equal to the potential difference between endpoints 3 and 0, thus:  

$$
V_{1}-V_{2}=V_{3}
$$  

Therefore:  

$$
a_{11}I-a_{21}I=a_{31}I
$$  

We obtain:  

$$
a_{13}=a_{31}=a_{11}-a_{12}=R_{1}-{\frac{1}{2}}R_{2}
$$  

Now returning to the required situation of the problem, without loss of generality, we can assume endpoints 3 and 0 are short-circuited and calculate the equivalent resistance between endpoints 1 and 2. In this case, if current flows into endpoint 1 with current I and out from endpoint 2, since endpoints 3 and 0 are short-circuited, there must be current flowing from 0 through the short-circuit wire into endpoint 3. Let the current flowing through the short-circuit wire be $I^{\prime}$, then it can be considered as the original four-terminal situation with current flowing into endpoint 1, out from endpoint 2, and into endpoint 3 with $I^{\prime}$. At this moment, the potential at endpoint 3 is:  

$$
V_{3}=a_{31}I-a_{32}I+a_{33}I^{\prime}
$$  

Because 3 and 0 are practically short-circuited, $V_{3}$ should be 0. Thus we can compute:  

$$
I^{\prime}=\frac{a_{32}-a_{31}}{a_{33}}I=\frac{R_{2}-R_{1}}{R_{1}}I
$$  

We can then compute the potentials at endpoints 1 and 2:  

The potential difference between endpoints 1 and 2:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{V_{1}=a_{11}I-a_{12}I+a_{13}I^{\prime}=(R_{1}-\displaystyle{\frac{1}{2}}R_{2})\displaystyle{\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}}I}}\ {{V_{2}=a_{21}I-a_{22}I+a_{23}I^{\prime}=\displaystyle{\frac{R_{2}}{2}}\displaystyle{\frac{R_{2}-2R_{1}}{R_{1}}}I}}\end{array}
$$  

$$
V_{1}-V_{2}=\frac{(2R_{1}-R_{2})R_{2}}{2R_{1}}I
$$  

Thus, the equivalent resistance between endpoints 1 and 2 is:  

$$

 Someone wants to release a cube with a mass of $M$ and with equal length, width, and height of $r$ at rest from one end of the valley at $\theta = 0$. It is released facing the slope. A layer of snow with a surface density of $\sigma$ is attached to the valley. The snow is in contact with the ground but does not interact, remaining stationary until it touches the object, at which point it adheres to its surface without altering the object's shape. Assuming gravitational acceleration $g$, there are the approximate conditions $\sigma r R \ll M, r \ll R$ (results are retained up to the first order of $r$). Determine the highest position the cube can reach at the other end (considering no rolling occurs).
","In this sub-question, energy is not conserved, but analyzing its motion still presents certain difficulties. Considering that the problem only requires accuracy to the first-order term, the loss of ascent quotient can be divided into two parts for correction, with zero-order motion considered during the correction process.  For the collision process between the square block and the snow, consider the conservation of momentum:  $$ M v = (M + \sigma\gamma u{\mathrm{d}}t)(v - {\mathrm{d}}v) $$  This results in:  $$ \mathrm{d}\upsilon = -\frac{\sigma r v^{2}}{M}\mathrm{d}t $$  The energy loss during the process is:  $$ d E = \frac{1}{2}(M + \mathrm{d}M)(\upsilon + \mathrm{d}\upsilon)^{2} - \frac{1}{2}(M)\upsilon^{2} = -\frac{1}{2}\sigma r\upsilon^{2}\upsilon\mathrm{d}t = -\frac{1}{2}\sigma r\upsilon^{2}\mathrm{d}s $$  In this case, it can be treated as linear motion, and the equation is not influenced by acceleration. Therefore, it can be corrected independently, with the zero-order velocity expression as:  $$ \upsilon_{0} = \sqrt{2g R(1-\cos\theta)} $$  Substituting into the integral:  $$ \delta W = \int f\mathrm{d}s = \int_{0}^{2\pi} -g R(1-\cos\theta)\sigma\boldsymbol{r}\cdot2R\sin\frac{\theta}{2}\mathrm{d}\theta = -\frac{32}{3}g R^{2}r\sigma $$  This gives the energy loss caused by collisions, which we convert into a height correction, then combine it with the correction for the gravitational component of the snow from the first question, resulting in the total reached height:  $$ \begin{array}{l} {{\delta y_{f} = \displaystyle\frac{32}{3}\displaystyle\frac{\sigma R^{2}r}{M}}}{{}}\\ {{\delta y_{g} = \displaystyle\frac{32}{3}\displaystyle\frac{\sigma R^{2}r}{M}}}{{}}\\ {{\delta y = \displaystyle\frac{64}{3}\displaystyle\frac{\sigma R^{2}r}{M}}} \end{array} $$  The two combined terms are both first-order and do not interfere with each other.

37,MECHANICS,"The curling can be approximated as a solid homogeneous cylinder with mass $m$, bottom surface radius $r$, and height $h$. Only the outer edge of the bottom is in contact with the ice surface, which has a friction coefficient $\mu$. The support force of the ice surface on the curling stone is $N=\int_{0}^{2\pi}n(\theta)\mathrm{d}\theta$,
where $n(\theta)$ is the distribution of the support force according to the polar coordinate $\theta$. When the curling is stationary on the horizontal ice surface, $n(\theta)=mg/2\pi$. Assume that the deformation of the outer edge of the curling is very small, and the elastic force satisfies Hooke's law. Therefore, it can be proven that the support force distribution has the form $n(\theta)=n_0+n_1\cos(\theta-\theta_0)$ (where $n_0$, $n_1$, and $\theta_0$ are unknown quantities). If the curling has a velocity $v$ in the positive direction along the x-axis, and also has an angular velocity $\omega$ in the clockwise direction (viewed from above), the curling will generate a lateral acceleration $a$ in the y-direction.

Assuming the direction of maximum deformation is $\theta_{0}$, we have:  

$$
x = r \cos{\left(\theta - \theta_{0}\right)}
$$  

According to Hooke's law:  

$$
n = k d = k d_{0} + k r \tan\alpha \cos\left(\theta - \theta_{0}\right) = n_{0} + n_{1} \cos\left(\theta - \theta_{0}\right)

Solving, we obtain $n_{0} = m g / 2\pi$.  

The friction force acting on the curling stone is proportional to the normal pressure:

For simplicity, we assume that the \""windward side\"" of the Trisolarian spaceship is a flat surface with an area $S$. During flight, dust floating in the universe may collide with it. We assume that the cosmic dust is composed of particles with rest mass $m$. For an observer on Earth: the spaceship moves at a constant speed of $v _1$, the particles in the cosmic dust have a speed of $v_2$ and move in the same direction as the spaceship, and the particles in the dust are uniformly distributed with a density of $n$.

If the particle density is $n_{0}$ in the rest frame of the cosmic dust itself, we have:  $$ n=n_{0}\gamma_{2}, n^{'}=n_{0}\gamma_{2}^{'} $$  Therefore, we can obtain $n^{\prime}=\frac{\gamma_{2}^{'}}{\gamma_{2}}n_{0}$.    Since $S$ is perpendicular to the direction of velocity, it is identical in both reference frames.

First, consider a small curved metal beam segment with a central angle of $\theta$ and radius of $\scriptstyle{\mathcal{R}}$, then the strain at $z$ is:

Resulting moment:  

$$
M = \int_{-\frac{h}{2}}^{\frac{h}{2}}\frac{E a}{R}z^{2}d z = \frac{E a h^{3}}{12R}

Given the approximation condition ${y}^{\prime}\ll1$:  

$$
R = {\frac{(1+y^{\prime2})^{\frac{3}{2}}}{|y^{\prime\prime}|}} \approx {\frac{1}{|y^{\prime\prime}|}}

Substitute into the previous equation:  

$$
M = {\frac{E a h^{3}|y^{\prime\prime}|}{12}}
$$

For the part of the metal beam with $\mathfrak{x}(\mathfrak{x}>0)$ and above, set up the moment equilibrium at the $\pmb{x}$ position:  

$$
M = \frac{m g}{2}(\frac{l}{2}-x)
$$

Substitute into the previous equation:  

$$
y^{\prime\prime} = \frac{6m g}{E a h^{3}}(\frac{l}{2}-x)
$$

Initial conditions:  

$$

Integrating yields:

y = {\frac{3m g l}{2E a h^{3}}}x^{2} - {\frac{m g}{E a h^{3}}}x^{3}
$$

Substitute $\begin{array}{r}{x=\frac{1}{2}}\end{array}$ to obtain:  

$$
\lambda = \frac{m g l^{3}}{4E a h^{3}}
$$

By the results of question (1), the metal beam can be equated to a spring with a stiffness coefficient of:  

$$

$$

This gives the angular frequency of vertical vibration:  

$$

As shown in the diagram, let the heavy object deviate from the center by $\delta l$, denote $\begin{array}{r}{\varepsilon=\frac{\delta\ell}{\ l}}\end{array}$

Similarly, for ${\mathfrak{x}}<{\mathfrak{0}}$:  

$$

Initial conditions:  

$$

$$

Substitute into equation (2) and solve using initial conditions:  

Substitute boundary conditions:

$$

$$
y_{1}\left(\frac{l}{2}\left(1-2\varepsilon\right)\right) = y_{2}\left(-\frac{l}{2}\left(1+2\varepsilon\right)\right) = \lambda^{\prime}
$$

Solve to obtain:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{k_{0}=\displaystyle\frac{2m g l^{2}}{E a h^{3}}\left(1-4\varepsilon^{2}\right)\varepsilon}} \\ {{\lambda^{\prime}=\displaystyle\frac{m g l^{3}}{4E a h^{3}}\left(1-4\varepsilon^{2}\right)^{2}}}\end{array}

When $\varepsilon\ll1$, we have:  

$$
\lambda^{\prime} \approx \frac{m g l^{3}}{4E a h^{3}}\left(1-8\varepsilon^{2}\right)
$$

Therefore, the gravitational potential energy of the heavy object is:  

$$

d E_{p2} = \int{\frac{1}{2}}E\epsilon^{2}d V = \int_{-{\frac{h}{2}}}^{{\frac{h}{2}}}{\frac{{\cal E}a y^{\prime\prime2}d x}{2}}z^{2}d z = {\frac{{\cal E}a h^{3}}{24}}y^{\prime\prime2}d x
$$

Integrating yields:  

$$
E_{p2} = \int_{-\frac{1}{2}(1+2\varepsilon)}^{0}\frac{E a h^{3}}{24}y_{2}^{\prime\prime}d x + \int_{0}^{\frac{1}{2}(1-2\varepsilon)}\frac{E a h^{3}}{24}{y_{1}^{\prime\prime}}^{2}d x = \frac{m^{2}g^{2}l^{3}(1-4\varepsilon^{2})^{2}}{8E a h^{3}} \approx \frac{m^{2}g^{2}l^{3}(1-8\varepsilon^{2})}{8E a h^{3}}

The kinetic energy of the ball is:  

$$
E_{k} = {\frac{1}{2}}m l^{2}{\dot{\varepsilon}}^{2}

89,ELECTRICITY,"A typhoon is a vortex-like weather system, and as it passes, it is often accompanied by lightning. When the electric field strength in the air reaches a certain value, the air breaks down, generating lightning. The breakdown field strength of air is denoted as $E_{m}$. The typhoon system is modeled as an isothermal atmospheric ideal gas with a temperature denoted as ${T}_{0}$. Under strong ionization conditions, it can be considered as consisting of neutral monoatomic gas (with mass $m_{tot}=m_{N}+m_{e}$) and free electrons (with mass $m_{e}$) released through ionization. It is known that each atom can ionize to release at most one electron, with the total number of monoatomic gas particles being $N$.

The rotation speed of the typhoon is ${\overrightarrow{\omega}}=\omega{\hat{z}}$. In this problem, we consider a cylindrical typhoon system with radius ${R}$ and height $H(H \gg R)$. Both the electrons and the positive ions are confined within this cylindrical volume and do not escape. Interactions between free electrons and free electrons, free electrons and positive ions, and positive ions and positive ions are ignored. Additionally, the effects of internal potential distributions within the typhoon on the distribution of free electrons and positive ions are not considered (calculated results can be simplified using $k=\frac{\omega^2}{2k_BT_0}$). The permittivity of free space is $\varepsilon_0$. 

After the typhoon has stabilized, researchers need to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather data within the typhoon system. The UAV has a volume of $V(V^{\frac{1}{3}} \ll R)$ and mass ${m}$. To ensure stable operation during data collection, the UAV must remain at a radius ${r_{0}}$ while orbiting the typhoon center with the same angular velocity $\omega$. It is known that the UAV can only exert thrust in the vertical direction. At time $t=0$, the UAV in stable operation experiences a small radial perturbation and acquires an initial radial velocity $\overrightarrow{v_{0}}$ with $v_{0} \ll \omega r_{0}$. Observations show that the UAV exhibits periodic precession. Solve for its precession angular frequency $\Omega$ (the answer can be expressed in terms of $q_{0}$ and $r_{0}$).","According to the problem statement, a single ideal gas under the isothermal model can satisfy the Boltzmann distribution in any continuous potential energy field distribution. By entering the rotating reference frame of the typhoon, centrifugal potential energy is introduced:

$$
V_{\text{eff}} = -\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2r^2
$$

Thus, the mass density of free electrons and positive ions satisfies:

$$
\rho_{-}(r) = \rho_{-0}e^{m_{\text{e}}kr^2}, \rho_{+}(r) = \rho_{+0}e^{m_{N}kr^2}
$$

Consider that the total number of electrons and positive ions satisfies the normalization condition:

Solving yields:

$$
N = \frac{\int_{0}^{R}2\pi r H\times\rho_{-}(r)dr}{m_e}, N = \frac{\int_{0}^{R}2\pi r H\times\rho_{+}(r)dr}{m_N}
$$

$$
\rho_{-}(r) = \rho_{-0}e^{-m_{e}kr^2} = \frac{k m_{e}^2N}{\pi H(e^{m_{e}k R^2}-1)}e^{m_{e}kr^2}
$$

$$
\rho_{+}(r) = \rho_{+0}e^{-m_{N}kr^2} = \frac{k m_{N}^2N}{\pi H(e^{m_{N}k R^2}-1)}e^{m_{N}kr^2}
$$

From

$$
PV = nRT
$$

It follows that

$$
P(r) = \left(\frac{\rho_{+}}{m_{N}} + \frac{\rho_{-}}{m_{e}}\right)k_{B}T_{0}
$$

$$
P(r) = \left(\frac{k m_{e}N}{\pi H(e^{m_{e}k R^2}-1)}e^{m_{e}kr^2} + \frac{k m_{N}N}{\pi H(e^{m_{N}k R^2}-1)}e^{m_{N}kr^2}\right)k_{B}T_{0}
$$

We prioritize considering the electric field intensity at the maximum electric field, analyzing symmetry $\vec{E} = E(r)\hat{r}$

$$
E(r) = \frac{\int_{0}^{r}(e\rho_{+} - e\rho_{-})(2\pi r \, dr)}{2\pi r\varepsilon_{0}H} = \frac{N e}{2\pi r H\varepsilon_{0}}\left[\frac{e^{m_{N}kr^2}-1}{e^{m_{N}k R^2}-1} - \frac{e^{m_{e}kr^2}-1}{e^{m_{e}k R^2}-1}\right]
$$

Considering when $\pmb{E}$ reaches maximum value, it satisfies:

$$
\frac{dE(r)}{dr} = 0
$$

Simplifying, the $r_{\text{max}}$ at maximum electric field satisfies the equation when $r = r_{\text{max}}$:

$$
\left[\frac{e^{m_{N}kr^2}-1}{e^{m_{N}k R^2}-1} - \frac{e^{m_{e}kr^2}-1}{e^{m_{e}k R^2}-1}\right] - 2kr^2\left[m_{N}\frac{e^{m_{N}kr^2}}{e^{m_{N}k R^2}-1} - m_{e}\frac{e^{m_{e}kr^2}}{e^{m_{e}k R^2}-1}\right] = 0
$$

Substituting the data, solving yields:

$$
r_{\text{max}} = 719.96 \, \mathrm{m}
$$

At this time:

$$
E_{\text{max}} = \frac{N e}{2\pi r_{\text{max}}H\varepsilon_{0}}\left[\frac{e^{m_{N}kr_{\text{max}}^2}-1}{e^{m_{N}k R^2}-1} - \frac{e^{m_{e}kr_{\text{max}}^2}-1}{e^{m_{e}k R^2}-1}\right] = -9.83 \times 10^{18} \, \mathrm{V/m}
$$

Since:

$$
\left|E_{\text{max}}\right| > E_m
$$

It can break down air.

For analyzing the forces on the drone in the ground reference frame, the buoyancy it experiences satisfies:

$$
\vec{F}' = (\rho_{-}(r_{0}) + \rho_{+}(r_{0}))V g\hat{z} + (\rho_{-}(r_{0}) + \rho_{+}(r_{0}))V\omega^2r_{0}(-\hat{r})
$$

In the $\hat{r}$ direction, list the force balance equation:

$$
E(r_{0})q_{0} - (\rho_{-}(r_{0}) + \rho_{+}(r_{0}))V\omega^2r_{0} = -m\omega^2r_{0}
$$

Substituting specific values, solving gives:

$$
q_{0} = \frac{-m\omega^2r_{0} + \left(\frac{k m_{\circ}^2N}{\pi H(\circ^{m_{\circ}kr_{0}^2}-1)}e^{m_{\circ}kr_{0}^2} + \frac{k m_{N}^2N}{\pi H(\circ^{m_{N}kr_{0}^2}-1)}e^{m_{N}kr_{0}^2}\right)V\omega^2r_{\circ}}{\frac{N e}{2\pi r_{0}H\varepsilon_{0}}\left[\frac{e^{m_{N}kr_{0}^2}-1}{e^{m_{N}kr_{0}^2}-1} - \frac{e^{m_{e}kr_{0}^2}-1}{e^{m_{\circ}kr_{0}^2}-1}\right]}
$$

Further consider the force balance equation in the $\hat{z}$ direction:

$$
F_{0} + (\rho_{-}(r_{0}) + \rho_{+}(r_{0}))V g - m g = 0
$$

Substitute specific values, solving yields:

$$
F_{0} = -(\rho_{-}(r_{0}) + \rho_{+}(r_{0}))V g + m g
$$

$$
F_{0} = m g - \left(\frac{k m_{e}^2N}{\pi H(e^{m_{e}k R^2}-1)}e^{m_{e}kr_{0}^2} + \frac{k m_{N}^2N}{\pi H(e^{m_{N}k R^2}-1)}e^{m_{N}kr_{0}^2}\right)V g
$$

With conservation of angular momentum:

$$
L_{0} = m r_{0}^2\omega
$$

Assume a relative stable position $\boldsymbol{r}_{0}$ with a perturbation distance $\delta r$, and write out the dynamic equation:

$$
m\ddot{\delta r} = \frac{L_{0}^2}{m(r_{0}+\delta r)^3} + E(r_{0}+\delta r)q_{0} - [\rho_{-}(r_{0}+\delta r) + \rho_{+}(r_{0}+\delta r)]V\omega^2(r_{0}+\delta r)
$$

Analyze and calculate the results in each term:

Effective centrifugal force term:

$$
\frac{L_{0}^2}{m(r+\delta r)^3} = \frac{L_{0}^2}{m r_{0}^3} + \frac{\partial\frac{L_{0}^2}{m r^3}}{\partial r}\delta r = \frac{L_{0}^2}{m r_{0}^3} - 3m\omega^2\delta r
$$

Radial electric field term:

$$
E(r_{0}+\delta r)q_{0} = E(r_{0})q + \frac{N e q_{0}}{2\pi H\varepsilon_{0}r_{0}^2}\left[\frac{(2k m_{N}r_{0}^2 - 1)e^{m_{N}kr_{0}^2} + 1}{e^{m_{N}k R^2} - 1} - \frac{(2k m_{e}r_{0}^2 - 1)e^{m_{e}kr_{0}^2} + 1}{e^{m_{e}k R^2} - 1}\right]\delta r
$$

Radial component of buoyancy term:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
-[\rho_{-}(r_{0}+\delta r) + \rho_{+}(r_{0}+\delta r)]V\omega^2(r_{0}+\delta r) =& -[\rho_{-}(r_{0}) + \rho_{+}(r_{0})]V\omega^2r_{0} - \ldots
\end{array}
$$

$$
\ldots \frac{k N V\omega^2}{\pi H}\left[\frac{(2k m_{N}r_{0}^2 + 1)e^{m_{N}kr_{0}^2}}{e^{m_{N}k R^2} - 1}m_{N}^2 + \frac{(2k m_{e}r_{0}^2 + 1)e^{m_{e}kr_{0}^2}}{e^{m_{e}k R^2} - 1}m_{e}^2\right]\delta r
$$

Since

$$
\frac{L_{0}^2}{m r_{0}^3} + E(r_{0})q_{0} - [\rho_{-}(r_{0}) + \rho_{+}(r_{0})]V\omega^2r_{0} = 0
$$

Zero-order term sum is zero, thus only considering the first-order terms, we obtain the precession angular frequency:

It experiences a drag force equal to $q c B$ in magnitude, opposite to the direction of velocity. It is known that the charged particle comes to a stop after turning through an angle $\theta_{0} (\theta_{0} > \frac{\pi}{2})$ in the direction of velocity, and at point $A$ on its trajectory, the velocity is parallel to the $x$-axis ($\theta_{A} = \frac{\pi}{2}$).

647,MECHANICS,"This problem discusses the motion and forces on a particle in a rapidly oscillating field.  First, we discuss the one-dimensional theory in a rapidly oscillating field. Let $q$ denote the coordinate of the particle. For a particle in a potential field $V_{0}(q)$ with mass $m$, if there is a rapidly oscillating force $f( \boldsymbol{q},t)$ acting on it (the angular frequency $ \omega$ of $f$ is very high), its equation of motion is:  $$ m{ \ddot{q}}=F_{0}=-{ \frac{ \mathrm{d}V_{0}}{ \mathrm{d}q}}(q)+f(q,t) $$    The core of the theory is to divide the actual motion into fast motion (high-frequency oscillation) and slow motion (average motion): fast motion is denoted as $x(t)$, and slow motion is denoted as $X$. Due to the high frequency, the response of $x$ is very small, that is $x \ll X$. Expanding the above equation:  $$ m \ddot{X}+m \ddot{x}=- \frac{ \mathrm{d}V_{0}}{ \mathrm{d}q} \Big \vert_{X}- \frac{ \mathrm{d}^{2}V_{0}}{ \mathrm{d}q^{2}} \Big \vert_{X} \cdot x+f(X,t)+ \frac{ \partial f}{ \partial x} \Big \vert_{X,t} \cdot x $$    First, solve for fast motion: $ \begin{array}{r}{m \ddot{x}=- \frac{ \mathrm{d}^{2}V_{0}}{ \mathrm{d}q^{2}} \Big \vert_{X} \cdot x+f(X,t)} \end{array}$, which is evidently a forced oscillation. Considering the high-frequency approximation, that is $ \begin{array}{r} { m \omega^{2} \gg \frac{ \mathrm{d}^{2}V_{0}}{ \mathrm{d}q^{2}} \bigg|_{X}} \end{array}$, we obtain  $$ x=-{ \frac{1}{m \omega^{2}}}f(X,t) $$    Thus, in fact, when studying rapidly oscillating forces, the second term on the right side of the equation does not have any practical effect.   Next, solve for the slow motion. Substitute the result of the fast motion into the actual dynamical equation to obtain the slow motion. Extending this situation to three dimensions, if $  abla \times f=0$, the effective potential $F_{ \mathrm{eff}}=-  abla V_{ \mathrm{eff}}$ can be written down.

For polar molecules, the centers of positive and negative charges are separated, forming an intrinsic dipole moment $\vec{p}_{i}$, such as in a water molecule. Under the influence of an external field, the positive and negative charge centers of non-polar molecules shift, forming a dipole. This mechanism is called induction polarization. For polar molecules, the intrinsic dipole moment rotates to a stable equilibrium position under the influence of the external field. This process is called orientation polarization. In this problem, we discuss the orientation polarization of the medium.

Assuming the dipole moment of a water molecule is $p_{w}$ and considering a system with a number density of water vapor molecules $n$, the interaction energy between the water dipole moment $p_{w}$ and the applied electric field is assumed to follow the Boltzmann distribution.

In the first approximation, the tension inside the rubber membrane can be described by the surface tension coefficient. A layer of rubber membrane is equivalent to a surface layer (the refractive index of the membrane is the same as that of water, and the membrane is extremely thin).  Tension formula:   \[ F =  \sigma l  \]  A hollow cylinder, with height  \(L \), radius  \(R \), has its two ends covered with a transparent rubber membrane with the same surface tension coefficient, and contains an ideal gas inside at pressure  \(p_0 \). The cylinder is submerged in a pool to a depth  \(H \) (assume  \(L  \ll H \), and the liquid-induced pressure on the upper and lower membranes is the same).

Consider infinitely many ideal semi-convex lenses, each placed equidistantly with an angular spacing of $\alpha$ between them. Each semi-convex lens is infinitesimally thin, allowing them to be arranged without mutual interference. These lenses are halved along their optical centers, and all optical centers are overlapped at the origin $O$ without crossing one another. Although there are infinitely many semi-convex lenses, $\alpha$ is an infinitesimal quantity, so the total angular range remains finite and does not extend infinitely in rotation. Finally, the focal length of each convex lens is $f$, which is an infinitely large quantity. However, the quantity $f\alpha = r_{0}$ is a finite, non-zero characteristic length in the limit. Below, all answers to the subsequent questions will be expressed in terms of $r_{0}$.

To solve the problem of determining the position and direction of a light ray perpendicular to the first lens upon exiting the last lens, we first perform an equivalence transformation: in fact, by tracing the trajectory of the light ray as it propagates between the lenses, it can be found that this problem is completely equivalent to the refraction of a light ray inside a spherical medium with a refractive index that varies with radius. Determine the refractive index distribution $n(r)$ of the sphere.

In classical mechanics, the ground state energy of a harmonic oscillator is zero. However, in quantum mechanics, due to the influence of the uncertainty principle, the harmonic oscillator’s ground state energy is not zero but rather $\begin{array}{r}{\cdot\frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega=\frac{1}{2}h\nu.}\end{array}$ The ground state energy of a harmonic oscillator, $\cdot{\frac{1}{2}}\hbar\omega$, is also called the vacuum zero-point energy.

$$
\overrightarrow{E}_{(z,t)}=\sum_{j}\widehat{\epsilon}_{j}A_{j}q_{j}(t)\sin{(k_{j}z)}

Substituting each harmonic oscillator into the equation satisfied by electromagnetic waves in a vacuum:
$$
\nabla^{2}\vec{E}-\frac{1}{c^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2}\vec{E}}{\partial t^{2}}=0

\ddot{q}_{j}+c^{2}k_{j}^{2}q_{j}=0

$$
E_{0}=\frac{1}{2}h\nu

This energy is referred to as the vacuum zero-point energy. As a result, even in the absence of photons, there exists a Casimir force between two parallel conducting plates in a vacuum.

Next, we use a simplified model to theoretically calculate the magnitude of the force arising from the Casimir effect.

489,MODERN,"The Bohr model holds historical significance as the first semi-classical quantum model of the hydrogen atom. It explained the challenges of classical electrodynamics regarding electron radiation and atomic stable states, as well as the results of spectroscopic observations at the time. Due to the limitations of quantum theory during its early development, it underwent modifications by Sommerfeld and others, eventually leading directly to the establishment of the Schrödinger equation by Schrödinger and others, which serves as the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics.

In the Bohr model, the principal quantum number $n$ simultaneously determines the energy and angular momentum of the electron state, which is actually incorrect. Through observation of hydrogen atoms in electric fields and magnetic fields, we point out that degenerate states under the same principal quantum number $n$ with different angular quantum numbers $l$, magnetic quantum numbers $m$, and even spin quantum numbers $s$ will experience energy level splitting. Specifically, some states' energy levels increase, while others decrease, and spectroscopic observations can reveal distinct spectral lines resulting from electronic level transitions between different states. The Stark effect is a typical effect when the hydrogen atom couples with an electric field. This problem attempts to estimate of the magnitude of energy level splitting due to the Stark effect using a semi-classical approach.

Consider the slow evolution of the electron's orbital in space under the influence of a weak uniform electric field $\vec{E}$. First, consider a simpler situation where at time $t=0$, the normal vector $\vec{n}$ of the plane of the electron's orbit and the electric field strength $\vec{E}$, along with the axis pointing from the nucleus to the pericenter of the orbit (the $x$-axis), are all situated in the $xOz$ plane, with an angle $\theta$ between the latter two. Use the perturbation method to prove that the magnitude of the angular momentum of the electron's orbit does not change over time, and the orbit merely precesses around the direction of the electric field $\vec{E}$ (that is, rotates around the axis). Determine this angular velocity $\Omega$. Given the orbital energy $-U$, eccentricity $e$, electron mass $m$, and the magnitude of charge for both the atomic nucleus and electron as $q$.

Hint: The so-called perturbation method refers to calculating the instantaneous derivative of the dynamical conserved quantity of the original system under the action of the newly added perturbing force at each moment. Substitute the position and velocity of the periodic motion of the original system into this derivative and calculate the periodic average. Finally, this averaged quantity is interpreted as the time derivative of a dynamical conserved quantity along the instantaneous orbit.

Since we are now studying the upright stability of the bicycle in a non-moving state, we can consider the front and rear wheels, body, and motor as a rigid body, abstracted as a homogeneous rigid rod that can only rotate in the plane around the contact point with the ground. The rod has a length $L$, mass $M$, and the momentum wheel connected to the rod's end can be driven by the motor to achieve any angular velocity. The momentum wheel is viewed as a disk with mass $m$ and radius $r$. (Ignore lateral slip at point $O$)

If the bicycle body obtains a clockwise rotation angle $\theta$ , the angular velocity that the previously stationary momentum wheel subsequently needs to acquire is 

In fact, when the bicycle tilt angle changes, the angular velocity and angular acceleration of the momentum wheel should also change correspondingly. We assume that sensors installed on the bicycle body can record the tilt angle $\theta$ and feedback to the motor, allowing the momentum wheel to acquire an angular acceleration of size $\dot{\omega}=K\theta$. To bring the bicycle back to a balanced position, solve for the dependency of $\omega$ on time $t$. ( $\theta<<1$, ignore any resistance, at $t=0$, $\theta=\theta_{0},\dot{\theta}=0$, and the angular velocity of the momentum wheel is 0)",,

539,MECHANICS,"**Transverse Waves on a String**

In this problem, we describe waves using the negative phase convention. In this convention, the most general form of a traveling wave is expressed as  

$$
\psi(x,t)=A e^{i(\pm k x-\omega t)}
$$  

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $k$ is the magnitude of the wave vector, the $""+""$ sign represents a wave traveling to the right, and the $""-""$ sign represents a wave traveling to the left. $A$ is the complex amplitude (its magnitude corresponds to the amplitude, while its phase angle contains the information about the phase). Next, we will consider transverse waves on a string, whose wave equation is  

$$
\frac{\partial^{2}\psi}{\partial x^{2}}-\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2}\psi}{\partial t^{2}}=0
$$  

where $u$ is the wave velocity. When $k$ and $\omega$ in the traveling wave expression satisfy $\omega/k=u$, it is a solution to the wave equation above. Due to the linearity of the wave equation, the superposition of solutions to the traveling wave is also a solution to this equation.  

Both ends A and B of a string are fixed to supports. We establish a coordinate axis with the midpoint (point O) as the origin and the positive direction of the $x$-axis pointing to the right. Thus, the coordinates of endpoints A and B are $±l/2$, where $l$ is the length of the string. At a point with a coordinate of $a$ on the string, a driver C with an angular frequency of $\omega$ is installed, causing all mass elements on the string to oscillate with an angular frequency of $\omega$.  

Let the amplitude reflection coefficient at the string's connection point with the supports be $\boldsymbol{r}$, which is defined as the ratio of the complex amplitude of the reflected wave to that of the incident wave at the reflection point. Assume that the incident wave between C and B is  

$$
A e^{i(k x-\omega t)}
$$  

We can introduce an inhomogeneous term into the wave equation to model the effect of the driver $C$:  

$$
\frac{\partial^{2}\psi}{\partial x^{2}}-\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2}\psi}{\partial t^{2}}=F\delta(x-a)e^{-i\omega t}
$$  

Here, $F$ characterizes the amplitude of the driving force. The function $\delta(x-a)$ is a delta function with the following properties: it exhibits a very narrow, tall pulse centered near ${\boldsymbol{x}}={\boldsymbol{a}}$, with the area under the pulse curve equal to 1. Using this property, we can write the relationship satisfied by the wave functions $\psi_{1}$ and $\psi_{2}$ to the left and right of C. This relationship is also known as the continuity condition.  

Finally, express $A$ in terms of $F$, $k$, $l$, and $a$.",,

190,MECHANICS,"The Blue Star people have always fantasized about one day being able to abandon the inefficient transportation method of rockets and directly establish a ""sky ladder"" from the ground to the heavens. Some call it a ""space elevator,"" while others refer to it as an ""orbital lift."" However, they do not realize that due to the limitations imposed by physical laws, building a space elevator on the Blue Star is unrealistic. In contrast, several years later, on Mars, which is farther from the sun, space elevators can ""stand tall.""

As early as the Book of Genesis in the Bible, humans hoped to jointly construct a towering tower that reaches from the ground to the sky—the Tower of Babel—to spread their fame. The person who first proposed the concept of a space elevator should be Russia's ""father of rockets""—Tsiolkovsky. His envisioned space elevator extends from the ground to the geostationary orbit, tens of thousands of kilometers high. As the elevator rises, the gravity inside gradually decreases. When cargo reaches the endpoint with the elevator, its speed is enough to maintain synchronous orbital movement around the Earth. Therefore, the station at the geostationary orbit is in a completely weightless state.

In 1979, Arthur C. Clarke's science fiction novel, ""The Fountains of Paradise,"" first brought this advanced concept of the space elevator into the public's view. Since then, space elevators have widely existed in various science fiction works. Whether it's the space elevator made with advanced nanomaterials in ""The Three-Body Problem"" or the three orbital lifts during the three-way division among Union, AEU, and Human Reform League in ""Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"" their basic concepts and principles are the same.

Nowadays, we can occasionally hear some related news reports, whether it's the Japanese company ""Obayashi Corporation"" planning to complete the first space elevator by 2050, or a Canadian company proposing a new space elevator plan. Regardless of whether these are just commercial companies engaging in hype, such news does indeed cause more people to wonder—are we really close to the era of abandoning rockets and embracing space elevators?

Is this really the case? How far away are we from the technology required to build space elevators? We will conduct a detailed analysis in this question (the space elevators mentioned below are all built at the equator, and any bending is not considered).

In fact, whether a material is destroyed or not depends not only on the magnitude of the force but also on the area over which the force acts. This is easy to understand; under the same amount of tension, thinner pipes are more easily pulled apart. Therefore, we need to use ""stress (force divided by the area of action)"" to measure whether a space elevator will be damaged. If the cross-sectional area of the space elevator is uniform, then obviously the place where the force is greatest, in other words, the geostationary orbit area, is the most prone to breaking.

Do we have any way to make the stress inside the entire space elevator equal? Of course we do! We know that the tension increases with height, so the cross-sectional area of an equal strength (internally equal tensile stress) space elevator should also increase with height. Therefore, the optimized space elevator design changes from a uniformly thick ""catenary"" to a funnel-shaped ""catenary"" with a thick top and thin bottom.

In this question, we use the following model: A mass at the end of the space elevator is considered infinitely large to ensure that only tensile forces act inside the elevator, so there is no force acting at the contact point with the ground. The elevator is thick at the top and thin at the bottom, with each cross-section having an equal tensile stress of σ. The material density is ρ, and the material elongation is not considered. The cross-sectional area at the ground level is \(A_{0}\). Solve the following problem:

Find the expression for the cross-sectional area \(A_{x}\) at a distance \(X\) from the center of the Earth, expressed in terms of \(g\), \(R\), \(\omega_{0}\) (Earth's rotational angular velocity), \(\sigma\), \(\rho\), and \(A_{0}\).",,

The surface states of topological insulators have unique electromagnetic wave propagation characteristics, involving **Berry phase**, **Chern number**, and **nonlinear effects**. These concepts can be understood through step-by-step derivation and analysis.

Consider the surface states of a three-dimensional topological insulator, whose low-energy effective Hamiltonian matrix is:
$$
H = v_F (\sigma_x k_y - \sigma_y k_x) + m \sigma_z

Where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity, $\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices, $k_x$ and $k_y$ are the wave vectors in momentum space, and $m$ is the mass term.

Let's define $\vert \psi(\mathbf{k})\rangle$ as the normalized eigenvector. Since there are two eigenvectors, for convenience we take the one with the negative eigenvalue (although the final results are clearly the same).

Berry connection is defined as:
$$
\vert A\rangle =\begin{pmatrix}
\langle \psi(\mathbf{k}) | \frac{\partial }{\partial k_x} | \psi(\mathbf{k})\rangle\\
\langle \psi(\mathbf{k}) | \frac{\partial }{\partial k_y} | \psi(\mathbf{k})\rangle

Under the combined influences of turbulent disturbances, precipitation, horizontal winds, and more complex convergence and uplift factors, their distribution becomes highly irregular. However, as an approximate model, we can consider only the vertical influences. This is because for the electric field of thunderstorm clouds, what truly concerns everyday life is essentially just the ""lightning that reaches the ground."" This portion of lightning can be understood by the vertical electric field surpassing the atmospheric breakdown limit, and the accumulation of the vertical electric field is of paramount importance.

Within thunderstorm clouds, negative ions are more likely to dissolve into raindrops and fall, resulting in a general pattern of positive charges above and negative charges below. As precipitation occurs, charge separation will continue to expand until the electric field becomes sufficiently large for lightning to occur.

Let us consider two cloud layers of equal thickness, with their thickness being much smaller than their vertical separation. Precipitation exists between them. Each raindrop has a radius of $r$, density $\rho$, carries negative charge, and the charge of each raindrop is proportional to its radius: $q = br$. The number density of raindrops is $n$. The friction force acting on a falling raindrop is proportional to the first power of its velocity: $f = -kv$, where $k$ is a constant. The resistance experienced by ions moving through the air can be expressed using the modified Stokes' formula: $F = -Ku$, where $K$ is a constant, and $u$ is the magnitude of the ion's velocity. Suppose all positive ions carry a single positive charge $e$, and compared to the electric field force, the gravitational force acting on the ions can be ignored. The gravitational acceleration is $g$, and the vacuum permittivity is $\epsilon_0$.

A particle with a static mass $m$ and negative charge $-q$ can, under the appropriate initial velocity, move in a uniformly spiraling motion on a cylindrical surface with radius $R$ due to the electrostatic force between it and the straight conductor.  Based on this, consider solving for the angular frequency $\omega$ of small radial oscillations when the initial velocity of the negative point charge changes to the composition of a very small radial velocity $v_r \ll v_z$ in the radial direction.

The angular velocity \(\omega\) of the metal spherical shell is along the positive \(x\)-axis. There is a uniform magnetic field in the space along the positive \(z\)-axis, with magnitude \(B\).

We assume that the spherical shell is not subject to any forces and torques other than electromagnetic forces, and we ignore the magnetic field generated by the shell's own current.

566,ADVANCED,"Alice and Bob are playing a game, roughly described as follows. Charlie is the host of the game. In each round, Charlie gives each of Alice and Bob a bit, \(x, y\), which means that each of them gets a number, 0 or 1. After receiving the bits, Alice and Bob each reply to Charlie with a bit, \(a, b\). To win the game, it is required that \(x\,\text{and}\, y = a\,\text{xor}\,b\). Alice and Bob can devise a strategy before the game, but they cannot communicate during the game.

We consider the following strategy:
A pair of entangled quantum bits can be described as
\[\ket{\phi}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\ket{00}+\ket{11}\right)\]
Here, \(\ket{mn}\) refers to the state of the system composed of two quantum bits, meaning the quantum state of the system where the quantum bit in Alice's hand is in state \(\ket{m}\) and the quantum bit in Bob's hand is in state \(\ket{n}\). The game process is that Alice first performs a measurement based on the \(x\) she received, and then Bob performs a measurement based on the \(y\) he received. They determine their reply bits \(a, b\) based on the measurement results.

Let's define the following states:
\[\begin{align*}
        \ket +&=\frac{1}{\sqrt2}\ket0+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket 1&
        \ket -&=\frac{1}{\sqrt2}\ket0-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket 1\\

        \ket{b_0}&=\cos\theta\ket 0-\sin\theta\ket1&\ket{b_1}&=\sin\theta\ket 0+\cos\theta\ket 1
    \end{align*}\]
where \(\theta=\pi/8\).

The specific measurement strategy is as follows:

**Alice's Measurement:**

* When Alice's random number \(x\) is 0, she uses the measurement basis \(\{\ket{1}, \ket{0}\}\).
    * If she measures \(\ket{1}\), the value she sends is 1.
    * If she measures \(\ket{0}\), the value she sends is 0.
* When Alice's random number \(x\) is 1, she uses the measurement basis \(\{\ket{+}, \ket{-}\}\).
    * If she measures \(\ket{+}\), the value she sends is 0.
    * If she measures \(\ket{-}\), the value she sends is 1.
   
**Bob's Measurement:**

* When Bob's random number \(y\) is 1, he uses the measurement basis \(\{\ket{b_1}, \ket{b_0}\}\).
    * If he measures \(\ket{b_1}\), the value he sends is 1.
    * If he measures \(\ket{b_0}\), the value he sends is 0.
* When Bob's random number \(y\) is 0, he uses the measurement basis \(\{\ket{a_0}, \ket{a_1}\}\).
    * If he measures \(\ket{a_0}\), the value he sends is 0.

579,THERMODYNAMICS,"Percolation is a geometric phase transition with profound significance in the study of localization and related topics. We use a model here to understand it. On a 2D lattice, lattice points can be occupied by black particles or be empty (white particles). The probability of placing a black particle is $p$, and the probability of being empty is $q=1-p$, where $N$ is the total number of particles.

It is clear that the probability of large clusters $\mathrm{\Delta}s$ appearing, where $n_{s}(p)$ at low values of $p$ is significant, decreases rapidly with $s$. However, when $p$ is large, one observes the emergence of macroscale $s$, which is the localization phenomenon. The transition occurring with $p$ is referred to as percolation. To study this problem, consider the influence between lattice points and transform it. We provide some approximate treatments: firstly, the number density of black particles is redefined as a dynamically changing $n$. We treat it as a function containing time $t$ and lattice coordinates $(x,y)$, and continuoize $(x,y)$ into a two-dimensional real number set instead of integer lattice coordinates. In our simple continuum model, the flux of number density between lattice points is exactly proportional to the gradient of the number density (consistent with the two-dimensional diffusion problem). However, in the actual discrete model, when localization occurs, a lattice point with certain probability is in a connected large cluster, with an internal number density always being 1; or the lattice point is located in an empty space or a small cluster with other probabilities, where the number density is less than 1. This links the continuous model with the discrete model: if the continuous model's $n(x,y)$ ultimately forms a stable distribution $n(r)$ rotationally symmetric around the origin and time-independent, where $r=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$, in this model, take a circle of radius $r_{0}$ such that the total number of particles inside is $N$, representing the characteristic particle number of a large cluster, and the edge particle number density $n(r_{0})$ should be related to the critical probability $p_{c}$ at which localization begins. We directly assume $n(r_{0})\cdot\pi r_{0}^{2}=p_{c}N$. Now, let $N=1$, and use $p_{c},r_{0}$ to represent $n(r)$.",,

459,ELECTRICITY,"The magnetoresistance effect refers to the phenomenon where the resistance value changes when a magnetic field is applied to a metal or semiconductor through which current is flowing. This phenomenon is called the magneto-resistance effect, also known as magnetoresistance (MR). Let the resistivity of the sample be $\rho_0$ when no magnetic field is applied, and $\rho_B$ when an external magnetic field is present. The magnitude of the magnetoresistance effect can be expressed as: $MR = \frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho_0}=\frac{\rho_B - \rho_0}{\rho_0}$.

The magnetoresistance effect in metals can usually be explained using a two-carrier model: In metals, there are two types of charge carriers, with mobilities $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ (mobility $=\frac{\text{drift velocity of the carrier}}{\text{magnitude of the field}}$), and corresponding conductivities $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$. Derive the relationship between the magnitude of the magnetoresistance effect and the external magnetic field strength $B$.

It is placed in an environment filled with a monoatomic gas that maintains a constant temperature $T_{0}$. The gas molecules have a mass $m$ and a number density $n$. Gravity is neglected. The properties of the two surfaces of the disk are different. The upper surface is ideally adiabatic, meaning gas molecules reflect off this surface like balls colliding on a smooth plane. The lower surface is ideally conductive, meaning when gas molecules collide with this surface in the disk's frame, they are re-emitted as if leaking from a small hole at temperature $T$, which is the temperature of the disk, with the emission directions being randomly distributed.  Note: The problem uses the following approximations: The relative temperature difference between the initial disk temperature and the gas temperature is very small, so the speed of the disk is always much less than the average speed of the gas; also, $M \gg m$. The Maxwell speed distribution law of the gas is known:  $$ {\mathrm{f}}({\vec{v}})={\Big(}{\frac{m}{2\pi k T}}{\Big)}^{\frac{3}{2}}\mathrm{exp}\left(-{\frac{m}{2k T}}v^{2}\right) $$  Assume that at a certain moment, the temperature of the disk is $T$, and its speed perpendicular to the plane of the disk is $u$ (positive upwards, negative downwards).

However, they do not realize that due to the limitations imposed by physical laws, building a space elevator on Blue Planet is unrealistic. In contrast, years later, on Mars, which is further from the Sun, space elevators can ""stand tall.""

As early as in the Book of Genesis in the Bible, humans hoped to jointly construct a giant tower reaching from the ground to the sky—the Tower of Babel—to proclaim their fame. The person who first proposed the concept of a space elevator should be the Russian ""father of rockets,"" Tsiolkovsky. The space elevator he envisioned would extend from the ground to the geosynchronous orbit tens of thousands of kilometers high. As the elevator ascends, the internal gravity gradually decreases. When cargo reaches the endpoint via the elevator, its speed already allows it to maintain synchronous orbital motion around Earth. Therefore, the synchronous orbit station is in a state of complete weightlessness.

In 1979, Arthur C. Clarke's science fiction novel ""The Fountains of Paradise"" introduced the revolutionary concept of the space elevator to the public's attention. Since then, space elevators have been widely present in various sci-fi works. Whether it is the space elevator made of advanced nanomaterials in ""The Three-Body Problem"" or the three orbital lifts operated by Union, AEU, and Human Reform League in ""Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"" the basic concepts and principles are the same.

Nowadays, we occasionally hear some related news reports, either from Japan's company ""Obayashi Corporation"" planning to build the first space elevator by 2050, or from a Canadian company proposing new space elevator schemes. Regardless of whether these are commercial companies creating hype, such news indeed prompts more people to wonder—are we really close to the era of abandoning rockets and embracing space elevators?

Is this really the case? How far away are we from the technology needed to build a space elevator? We will conduct a detailed analysis in this matter (the space elevators discussed here are all constructed at the equator, with no consideration for any curvature).

In Tsiolkovsky's vision, the space elevator following Earth's rotation would reach a certain height, after which a satellite released freely would automatically become a geostationary satellite. Calculate the height $l_{1}$ of the space elevator in this model. Given are: gravitational acceleration $g$, Earth's radius $R$, and Earth's rotation period $T_{day}$.",,

When studying such systems, the physical quantities we are interested in are the proportion of energy or momentum transmitted by the collision cascade and its dependence on the coefficient of restitution \( e \) and the collision mass ratio. We arrange \( n(n\gg1) \) balls (with masses \( m_{i}(i=1,2,...,n) \), adjustable) between an initial ball with mass \( M \) (fixed) and an end ball with mass \( m \) (fixed). Only the first collision between adjacent balls is considered. All collisions are inelastic with a coefficient of restitution \( e \) (very close to 1).

Recently, Ricardo and Lee proved that when the mass distribution of the cascade ball chain is such that the mass \( m_{i} \) of each ball is the geometric mean of the masses of the two adjacent balls \( \sqrt{m_{i-1}m_{i+1}} \), the efficiency of kinetic energy and momentum transfer between the initial and final balls is maximized.

108,OPTICS,"When electromagnetic waves undergo total internal reflection at an interface, it has been observed that under certain circumstances, the reflected wave experiences a lateral shift along the interface relative to the point of incidence. This phenomenon is historically known as the ""Goos-Hänchen shift."" The core concept is that during total internal reflection, the reflected wave acquires an additional phase $Φ(\theta)$, which depends on the angle of incidence $\theta$ (typically decreasing as the angle of incidence increases, becoming zero at the critical angle $\theta$ for total internal reflection, with its derivative with respect to the angle of incidence becoming infinite at the critical angle). When the incident wave is not a perfect plane wave, electromagnetic waves with closely spaced but different angles of incidence can interfere. The condition for this interference to occur is that the reflected waves from different angles of incidence must achieve equal phase by undergoing a lateral shift $d$ along the interface.

Now, by solely considering the presence of thermal resistance (ignoring factors such as heat leakage and friction), an ideal cycle process—the internally irreversible Carnot cycle—is introduced. The internally irreversible Carnot cycle satisfies the following three conditions:

(i) The working substance undergoes a quasi-static Carnot cycle;  

(ii) Due to the thermal resistance between the working substance and the heat source, the temperatures $T_{1},T_{2}$ of the two isothermal processes that the working substance undergoes are different from the heat source temperatures $T_{H},T_{L}$, specifically: $T_{H} > T_{1} > T_{2} > T_{L}$. In this way, there is a finite temperature difference between the heat source and the working substance, allowing heat conduction to occur over a finite period, resulting in power output from the cycle;

Physics is not only the study of the composition and forms of interaction of matter, but also how new physical concepts are constructed at different theoretical levels, and more remarkably, how profound connections between physical concepts at different levels are revealed. Based on this idea, let's look at the following questions concerning connections, which are themselves interconnected.

In fact, diffusion is also a typical transport process. We can consider a gaseous medium, where a dilute component (thus the mechanical effects caused by its diffusion can be neglected) is composed of (quasi)particles with effective charge and mass $q, m$. Before discussing diffusion, let's consider the following question: if the system maintains a temperature $T$, and a uniform magnetic field $\pmb{B}$ is applied to the gas. Then, when scattering of particles is not considered $(\gamma\rightarrow0)$, the particles originally conforming to the Maxwell distribution in the medium will now rotate around the magnetic field. Next, we consider the evolution caused by the diffusion of particles in the external magnetic field. We let a large number of particles start at rest from the origin. Its dynamics equation can be phenomenologically written as:

$$
m{\ddot{r}}=f-\gamma{\dot{r}}+q{\dot{r}}\times B
$$

where $\pmb{f}=-\gamma\pmb{v}$ reflects the scattering (or damping) of the particles, and $q\dot{\pmb r}\times\pmb B$ is the force caused by the magnetic field, with the magnetic field taken as ${\boldsymbol{B}}= B e_{z}$. Meanwhile, $\pmb{f}$ reflects the forces caused by thermal factors, which is a function that randomly changes over time and is independent of the particle's location, with an average value of zero. Compute the average of the angular momentum in the $z$ direction $J=\langle m(x{\dot{y}}-y{\dot{x}})\rangle$.

The dielectric constant in vacuum is $\varepsilon_{0}$, and the Boltzmann constant is $k$. For convenience in expressing the answer, introduce a dimensionless constant $x=N\alpha/\varepsilon_{0}S L$, so $\alpha$ no longer appears in the answer.

The number density of carriers is $n$. A cylindrical coordinate system $(z,r,\theta)$ is established inside the cylinder, with the origin being the center of the circular top surface, the $z$ axis pointing axially outward along the cylinder, and $r$ pointing radially outward. During the process, the charge volume density $\rho$ and current densities $j_{r}, j_{\theta}$ inside the cylinder will vary with time $t$, and they are also functions of spatial coordinates $r$ and $\theta$. Due to the translational symmetry along the $z$ axis, the current density in the $z$ direction, $j_{z}$, will always be zero, and all non-zero physical quantities are independent of the $z$ coordinate.

495,OPTICS,"In 1845, Faraday studied the influence of electricity and magnetism on polarized light and discovered that heavy glass, originally non-optically active, exhibited optical activity under the influence of a strong magnetic field, causing the plane of polarization of polarized light to rotate. This was the first time humanity recognized the relationship between electromagnetic phenomena and light phenomena. The magneto-optical rotation effect later became known as the Faraday Effect.

In the magneto-optical rotation effect, the rotation angle of the vibration plane \(\beta\) is proportional to the distance \(d\) that light travels through the medium and is also proportional to the magnetic induction intensity \(B\) within the medium, expressed as:
\[
\beta = vBd
\]
where \(v\) is the proportionality constant, known as the Verdet constant, which depends on the properties of the medium and is also related to the wavelength of the incident light. Assume that the medium can be modeled using the Lorentz model, where the medium is composed of atoms, with \(N\) atoms per unit volume, and each atom contains \(Z\) electrons in the outer shell. The outer electrons deviate from their equilibrium positions and are subject to linear restoring forces: \(\vec{f} = -k\vec{r}\), with the harmonic resonance frequency of the outer shell electrons being \(\omega_0\). The interaction between the incident light and the medium exclusively involves the outer shell electrons.

Circularly polarized light can be regarded as the result of the synthesis of two linearly polarized light waves with the same frequency and direction, mutually perpendicular vibration axes, and a stable phase relationship. The two linearly polarized light waves have the same amplitude and a phase difference of \(\pm\pi/2\), representing left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light, respectively. Similarly, a linearly polarized light wave can be decomposed into left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized components.

Based on these models, calculate the Verdet constant \(\beta\) for incident light with an angular frequency of \(\omega\). Assume that the medium does not absorb the incident light and its refractive index near the angular frequency \(\omega\) is \(n\).","Solution: The propagation of light waves in a medium under an applied magnetic field involves the motion of electrons:
\[m\ddot{\vec{r}} = -k\vec{r} - g\vec{v} - e(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})\]
\(\vec{E}\) is the electric field intensity of the incident light wave; \(\vec{B}\) is the magnetic induction intensity applied to the medium; \(g\) is the damping term, and since the medium does not absorb the incident light, it exhibits weak damping and low loss, thus neglecting the damping term:
\[m\ddot{\vec{r}} = -k\vec{r} - e(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})\]
Let \(\vec{B}\) be along the positive \(z\)-axis, which is also the propagation direction of the light wave, thus:
\[
\begin{cases}
m\ddot{x} + e\dot{y}B + kx = -eE_x \\
m\ddot{y} - e\dot{x}B + ky = -eE_y
\end{cases}
\]
Assuming the incident wave is a steady-state wave, the relationship between the electric field and time: \(e^{-i\omega t}\)
The relationship between the perturbation term of the forced vibration of the outer electrons and time: \(e^{-i\omega t}\)
Thus: \(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \equiv -i\omega\), \(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} \equiv -\omega^2\), therefore:
\[
\begin{cases}
(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)r_x - i\omega\Omega r_y = -\frac{e}{m}E_x \\
(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)r_y + i\omega\Omega r_x = -\frac{e}{m}E_y
\end{cases}
\]
Where:
\(\Omega = \frac{eB}{m}\), \(\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\)

For left-hand circularly polarized light, \(E_+ = E_x + iE_y\), then: \(r_+ = r_x + ir_y\)
\[(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 - \omega\Omega)r_+ = -\frac{e}{m}E_+\]
Solving this, we get:
\[r_+ = -\frac{e}{m(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 - \omega\Omega)}E_+\]
The polarization vector: The atomic number density of the medium is \(N(1/m^3)\), with each atom providing \(Z\) electrons weakly bound in the outer layer;
\[\vec{P}_+ = NZ(-e)\vec{r}_+ = \frac{NZ\frac{e^2}{m}}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 - \omega\Omega}E_+\]
Since \(P = \varepsilon_0\chi E\), thus:
\[\chi_+ = \frac{NZ\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 m}}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 - \omega\Omega}\]
The refractive index for left-hand circularly polarized light is:
\[n_+^2 = \varepsilon_+ = (1 + \chi_+) = 1 + \frac{NZ\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 m}}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 - \omega\Omega}\]

For right-hand circularly polarized light \(E_- = E_x - iE_y\), then: \(r_- = r_x - ir_y\)
\[(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 + \omega\Omega)r_- = -\frac{e}{m}E_-\]
Solving this, we get:
\[r_- = -\frac{e}{m(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 + \omega\Omega)}E_-\]
\[\vec{P}_- = NZ(-e)\vec{r}_- = \frac{NZ\frac{e^2}{m}}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 + \omega\Omega}E_-\]
Thus:
\[\chi_- = \frac{NZ\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 m}}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 + \omega\Omega}\]
The refractive index for right-hand circularly polarized light is:
\[n_-^2 = \varepsilon_- = (1 + \chi_-) = 1 + \frac{NZ\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 m}}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 + \omega\Omega}\]
That is, the refractive indices for left-hand and right-hand circularly polarized light are different:
\[n_{\pm}^2 = \varepsilon_{\pm} = (1 + \chi_{\pm}) = 1 + \frac{NZ\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 m}}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 \mp \omega\Omega}\]

Any linearly polarized light can be decomposed into two circularly polarized lights with the same frequency, equal amplitude, and a stable phase relationship. When linearly polarized light passes through a medium with an external magnetic field aligned with the direction of propagation, the rotation angle of the polarization plane is:
\[\beta = \frac{1}{2}(\alpha_+ - \alpha_-) = \frac{\pi}{\lambda}(n_+ - n_-)d\]
where \(d\) is the propagation length of light in the medium.

Find \((n_+ - n_-)\)
\[
\begin{align*}
n_+^2 - n_-^2 &= (n_+ - n_-)(n_+ + n_-)\\
&= NZ\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 m} \cdot \frac{2\omega\Omega}{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2 - (\omega\Omega)^2}
\end{align*}
\]
Generally, the cyclotron frequency \(\Omega\) is much smaller than the optical frequency \(\omega\), and the optical frequency \(\omega\) is not near the resonance frequency \(\omega_0\), hence:
\[n_+ + n_- \approx 2n\]
\[n^2 \approx 1 + NZ\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 m} \cdot \frac{1}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2}\]
Therefore:
\[n_+ - n_- = NZ\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 mn} \cdot \frac{\omega\Omega}{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2}\]
Thus:
\[
\begin{align*}
\beta &= \frac{\pi}{\lambda}(n_+ - n_-)d = \frac{\omega}{2c}NZ\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 mn} \cdot \frac{\omega\Omega}{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2}Bd = \frac{NZ e^3}{2c\varepsilon_0 m^2 n} \cdot \frac{\omega^2}{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2} \cdot Bd\\
&= vBd
\end{align*}
\]
The Verdet constant is obtained as:

A concentric spherical shell with inner and outer radii of $R_{1}=R$ and $R_{2}=2^{1/3}R$, and magnetic permeability $\mu=3\mu_{0}$, is placed in an external uniform magnetic field with magnetic flux density $B_{0}$ and the magnetic field generated by a fixed magnetic dipole located at the center of the sphere. The magnetic dipole has a magnetic moment $m$ that is aligned with the external magnetic field. The system reaches magnetostatic equilibrium. To solve this problem, we can use the method of magnetic scalar potential. The concept is to express the magnetic field intensity as ${\pmb{H}}=-\nabla\varphi$, where $\varphi$ is referred to as the magnetic scalar potential. This approach applies to all three regions: the space inside the shell, the space outside the shell, and the region within the shell itself. The relationship between magnetic flux density and magnetic field intensity is $B=\mu H$.

If the magnetic moment is rotated by an angle $\alpha$, calculate the torque it experiences. The answer should be expressed in terms of $m$, $B_0$, and $\alpha$. Please verify the result before outputting.

The proportionality coefficient is denoted as $\alpha$.

Next, we will estimate the coefficient $\alpha$ based on the classical oscillator model of atoms. In this model, the atomic nucleus can be considered stationary, while the electron, when in motion, is bound by the nucleus. This binding force can be approximated as a linear restoring force: $-m\omega_{0}^{2}x$. Here, $\mathsf{m}$ is the mass of the electron, $\omega_{0}$ is the natural angular frequency (describing the strength of the restoring force), and $x$ is the distance between the electron and the nucleus.

Determine the expression for the $x$-coordinate of the particle relative to the carriage's reference frame as a function of time $t$. Use the small-angle approximation. At $t=0$, $x=0$. Express the answer in terms of $M$ and $\Omega$. Consider the effects of the Coriolis force caused by the Earth's rotation in this scenario.","The two components of the force exerted on the small ball can be approximated as:  

$$
(F_{x},F_{y})=\left(-\frac{m g}{l}x,-\frac{m g}{l}y\right)
$$

Assume the coordinate of the carriage is $x$. Then the Coriolis force acting on the small ball is:  

$$
(C_{x},C_{y})=\Big(2m\Omega\dot{y},-2m\Omega(\dot{X}+\dot{x})\Big)
$$

Newton's laws:  

$$
F_{\pi}+C_{x}=m\left(\ddot{X}+\ddot{x}\right)
$$

$$
F_{y}+C_{y}=m{\ddot{y}}
$$

$$
F-F_{x}=M\ddot{X}
$$

Rearranging:  

$$
\ddot{X}-\frac{m g}{M l}x=\frac{F}{M}
$$

$$
\ddot{X}+\ddot{x}+\frac{g}{l}x-2\Omega\dot{y}=0
$$

$$
\ddot{y}+\frac{g}{l}y+2\Omega(\dot{X}+\dot{x})=0
$$

We find the following particular solutions $\scriptstyle X={\frac{1}{2}}a t^{2}$ ${\pmb y}=b t$ ${\pmb x}={\pmb c}$  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{a-\displaystyle\frac{m}{M}\omega_{0}^{2}c=\displaystyle\frac{F}{M}}}\ {{}}\ {{a+\omega_{0}^{2}c-2\Omega b=0}}\ {{}}\ {{\omega_{0}^{2}b+2\Omega a=0}}\end{array}
$$

From this, we obtain:  

$$
X_{0}=\frac{25F}{57M}t^{2}\quad,\quad y_{0}=-\frac{10F}{57M\Omega}t\quad,\quad x_{0}=-\frac{7F}{57M\Omega^{2}}
$$

The final solution should be $X=X_{0}+X_{1}$, ${\mathfrak{y}}={\mathfrak{y}}_{0}+{\mathfrak{y}}_{1}$ ${\boldsymbol{x}}={\boldsymbol{x}}_{0}+{\boldsymbol{x}}_{1}$, where $X_{1}, y_{1}, x_{1}$ satisfy the corresponding homogeneous equations. Let:

$$
X_{1}, x_{1}, y_{1}=A, B, C\mathrm{e}^{i\omega t}
$$

Substituting these into the equations results in the matrix equation:  

$$
\left[\begin{array}{c c c}{{-\omega^{2}}}&{{-m\omega_{0}^{2}/M}}&{{0}}\ {{-\omega^{2}}}&{{-\omega^{2}+\omega_{0}^{2}}}&{{-2\mathrm{i}\Omega\omega}}\ {{2\mathrm{i}\Omega\omega}}&{{2\mathrm{i}\Omega\omega}}&{{-\omega^{2}+\omega_{0}^{2}}}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}{{A}}\ {{B}}\ {{C}}\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{l}{{0}}\ {{0}}\ {{0}}\ {{0}}\end{array}\right]
$$

Taking the determinant of the coefficient matrix equal to zero allows it to be factored:  

$$
\omega^{2}\left(\omega^{2}-6\Omega^{2}\right)\left(\omega^{2}-19\Omega^{2}\right)=0
$$

The case $\omega^{2}=0$ corresponds to the trivial solution:  

$$
X_{1}, x_{1}, y_{1}=C_{1}, 0, 0
$$

The solution for $\omega=\sqrt{6}\Omega$ is:  

$$
X_{1}, x_{1}, y_{1}=C_{2}, -6C_{2}, \frac{5\sqrt{6}}{2}\mathrm{i}C_{2}\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\omega t}
$$

The solution for $\omega=19\Omega$ is:  

$$
X_{1}, x_{1}, y_{1}=C_{3}, -19C_{3}, -4\sqrt{19}\mathrm{i}C_{3}\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\omega t}
$$

By superimposing these three solutions and considering the initial conditions:  

$$
C_{1}+C_{2}+C_{3}=0
$$

$$
-6C_{2}-19C_{3}+c=0
$$

$$
-\frac{5\sqrt{6}}{2}\cdot\sqrt{6}\Omega\cdot C_{2}+4\sqrt{19}\cdot\sqrt{19}\Omega\cdot C_{3}+b=0
$$

We obtain:  

$$
C_{1}=\frac{59F}{3249M\Omega^{2}}\quad,\quad C_{2}=-\frac{2F}{117M\Omega^{2}}\quad,\quad C_{3}=-\frac{5F}{4693M\Omega^{2}}
$$

Finally, substituting these into the equations and taking the real part:  

$$
\boxed{x=-\frac{7F}{57M\Omega^{2}}+\frac{4F}{39M\Omega^{2}}\cos{\sqrt{6}}\Omega t+\frac{5F}{247M\Omega^{2}}\cos{\sqrt{19}}\Omega t}

\boxed{x=-\frac{7F}{57M\Omega^2}+\frac{4F}{39M\Omega^2}\cos(\sqrt{6}\Omega t)+\frac{5F}{247M\Omega^2}\cos(\sqrt{19}\Omega t)}

101,MECHANICS,"The problem discusses a stick figure model. The stick figure's head is a uniform sphere with a radius of $r$ and a mass of $m$, while the rest of the body consists of uniform rods with negligible thickness and a mass per unit length of $\lambda$. All parts are connected by hinges. Specifically, the torso and both arms have a length of $l$, while the legs have a length of $1.2l$. $\theta$ represents the angle between the arms and the torso, and $\varphi$ represents the angle between the legs and the extended torso line (not an obtuse angle). The stick figure is composed of a head, a torso, two arms, and two legs. Initially, the stick figure is in a state where $\theta=\textstyle{\frac{\pi}{2}}$ and $\varphi={\frac{\pi}{4}}$. The head has a mass of $m=0.6\lambda l$, with the result expressed in terms of $\lambda$. 

The stick figure is a simulation of a real biological body, so if necessary, the connections between the torso and the arms/legs, in addition to providing interaction forces, can also exert a couple (i.e., a torque), even if there is no interaction force between them. This net torque is independent of the choice of reference point. In the following discussion, this will be referred to simply as a ""couple.""

During a certain free-fall motion, the stick figure, overwhelmed with panic, forgets to bring its legs together and swings its arms and torso with an amplitude of $\theta_{0}$ (small angle) and an angular frequency of $\omega$. As a result, its legs passively oscillate near $\varphi={\frac{\pi}{4}}$. Find the amplitude of resonance for the legs (seek the steady-state solution starting from the initial position). Assume that the stick figure can actively generate a couple for the arms but not for the legs.","

(1) The forces are already marked on the diagram. List Newton's laws and rotational equations, assuming the displacement of the driven object is $\pmb{x}$, positive upwards.

Vertical direction of the leg

Vertical direction of the arm

Horizontal direction of the leg

$$

Horizontal direction of the arm

$$
-T_{2}=\lambda l\times0.5l\times{\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}}\left(\mathrm{sin}\theta\right)
$$

Angular momentum theorem for the leg

$$
T_{3}\times0.6l\mathrm{sin}\varphi+T_{4}\times0.6l\mathrm{cos}\varphi-M=\frac{1}{12}\times1.2\lambda l\times(1.2l)^{2}\ddot{\varphi}
$$

Angular momentum theorem for the arm

$$
T_{2}\times0.5l\mathrm{cos}\theta-T_{1}\times0.5l\mathrm{sin}\theta=\frac{1}{12}\times\lambda l\times l^{2}\ddot{\theta}
$$

Substitute in, we have

$$
\frac{1}{12}l^{2}{\ddot{\theta}}+0.25l^{2}{\mathrm{cos}}\theta\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}{\mathrm{sin}}\theta+\frac{T_{1}}{\lambda}\times0.5{\mathrm{sin}}\theta=0
$$

By combining the previous equations, we get

$$
T_{1}=\left({\frac{6}{25}}{\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}}\left(\mathrm{cos}\varphi\right)-{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}}\left(\mathrm{cos}\theta\right)\right)\lambda l^{2}

Therefore,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{A(\theta)=\displaystyle\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{12}\mathrm{sin}^{2}\theta}}\ {{{}}}\ {{B(\theta)=-\displaystyle\frac{1}{12}\mathrm{sin}\theta\mathrm{cos}\theta}}\ {{{}}}\ {{C(\theta)=\displaystyle\frac{3}{25}\omega^{2}\mathrm{sin}\theta}}\end{array}

T_{3}\times0.6l\mathrm{sin}\varphi+T_{4}\times0.6l\mathrm{cos}\varphi=\frac{1}{12}\times1.2\lambda l\times(1.2l)^{2}\ddot{\varphi}

Substitute and combine, we get

T_{3}\times0.6l\mathrm{sin}\varphi-1.2\times0.6\lambda l^{2}{\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}}(\mathrm{sin}\varphi)\times0.6l\mathrm{cos}\varphi={\frac{1}{12}}\times1.2\lambda l\times(1.2l)^{2}\ddot{\varphi}

$$
T_{3}=\lambda l\left(\ddot{x}-0.5l\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}\left(\mathrm{cos}\theta\right)\right)+\frac{1}{2}(m+\lambda l)\ddot{x}
$$

Combining, we get

$$
T_{3}=-\frac{1}{5}\lambda l^{2}\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}\left(\mathrm{cos}\theta\right)+\frac{54}{125}\lambda l^{2}\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}\left(\mathrm{cos}\varphi\right)
$$

Substituting the above equation, we obtain the final expression

$$
\left({\frac{54}{125}}{\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}}\left(\mathrm{cos}\varphi\right)-{\frac{1}{5}}{\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}}\left(\mathrm{cos}\theta\right)\right)\mathrm{sin}\varphi-{\frac{18}{25}}{\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}}\left(\mathrm{sin}\varphi\right)\mathrm{cos}\varphi={\frac{6}{25}}{\ddot{\varphi}}

Let = +, then retain terms up to the first order of and θ, we get

$$

The proportion of the molar amount of fuel gas is $\alpha$, and the rest is air. Alcohol is chosen as the fuel, with the reaction equation in air as: $C_{2}H_{5}OH(g) + 3O_{2}(g) \rightarrow 3H_{2}O(g) + 2CO_{2}(g)$. Assume that the air contains only $N_{2}$ and $O_{2}$, all gases are considered as ideal gases, and none of the vibrational degrees of freedom are excited. It is known that under conditions of pressure $P_{0}$ and temperature $T_{0}$, the reaction heat is $-\lambda$ (enthalpy change for $1\mathrm{mol}$ of ethanol reacting under isothermal and isobaric conditions).

Find the magnitude of the hound's acceleration at this moment.","To solve $\textcircled{1}$, the hunting dog performs uniform circular motion. Thus, the tangential acceleration is zero, while the normal acceleration changes.

$$

During the time interval $\mathrm{d}t$, the fox and the hunting dog respectively reach positions $F^{\prime}$ and $D^{\prime}$ (see Figure 1.7(a) in the problem). The angle turned by the hunting dog's direction of motion is  

$$

However, the distance traveled by the fox is  

$$

There is now an electrolyte with thickness $L$ in the $z$ direction, infinite in the $x$ direction, and infinite in the $y$ direction. The region where $y > 0$ is electrolyte 1, and the region where $y < 0$ is electrolyte 2. The conductivities of the two dielectrics are $\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}$, and the dielectric constants are $\varepsilon_{1}, \varepsilon_{2}$, respectively. On the $xOz$ interface of the two dielectrics, two cylindrical holes with a radius $R$ are drilled in the $z$ direction, spaced $2D (D > R, R, D \ll L)$ apart, with centers located on the interface as long straight cylindrical holes. Two cylindrical bodies $\pm$ are inserted into the holes, with the type of the cylinders given by the problem text below.

The cylindrical bodies $\pm$ are metal electrodes filling the entire cylinder. Initially, the system is uncharged, and at $t=0$, a power source with an electromotive force $U$ and internal resistance $r_{0}$ is used to connect the electrodes. Find the relationship between the current through the power source and time, denoted as $i(t)$.","Given the potential difference $u$, it can be seen:

$$
I=\iint\sigma\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{S}=\frac{\sigma_{1}+\sigma_{2}}{2}\times\frac{2\pi u L}{2\mathrm{arccosh}(D/R)}

Given the current $i$ passing through the power source, this current changes the net charge:

$$
{\frac{d(\lambda L)}{d t}}=i-I=i-{\frac{2\pi u L}{2\mathrm{arccosh}(D/R)}}={\frac{\pi(\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{2})L}{2\mathrm{arccosh}(D/R)}}{\frac{d u}{d t}}

409,ELECTRICITY,"In electromagnetism, we often study the problem of electromagnetic field distribution in a region without charge or current distribution. In such cases, the electromagnetic field will become a tubular field. The so-called tubular field is named because of the nature of the velocity field of an incompressible fluid at every instant. Its characteristic can be described using the language of vector analysis as the field's divergence being equal to zero. Another perspective is that if we take the field lines of a vector field $\pmb{F}$ (the tangent line at each point being the direction of field strength) and select a flux tube along a set of field lines passing through a certain cross-section, then at any cross-section of the flux tube, the field flux:

$$
\int F\cdot\mathrm{d}S=\Phi
$$  

will be a conserved quantity. This problem will investigate a special case of a tubular field that is rotationally symmetric around the $z$ axis: using oblate spheroidal coordinates to construct a unique tubular field as an electric field or magnetic field. The so-called oblate spheroidal coordinate system is similar to spherical coordinates, and it is generated by the following coordinate transformations:

$$
x= a \mathrm{ch}\mu \cos \nu \cos \varphi
$$  

$$
y= a \mathrm{ch}\mu \cos \nu \sin \varphi
$$  

$$
z=a\mathrm{sh}\mu\sin\nu
$$  

We want the shape of the field lines of an electric field or magnetic field to precisely follow its generatrix direction, i.e., the tangent direction of the curve where field strength changes with $\mu$ while $\nu,\varphi$ remain fixed (upwards when $\relax z>0$). 

Find the charge distribution in the $xy$ plane that can produce this electric field distribution. Assume the field strength near the origin is $E_0$. The dielectric constant is $\varepsilon_{0}$.","First, we determine the equation of the constant-$\mu$ line. Now, using the trigonometric identity $\sin^{2}\nu+\cos^{2}\nu=1$, we eliminate the parameter $\nu$:

$$
{\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}{\mathrm{ch}}^{2}\mu}}+{\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2}{\mathrm{sh}}^{2}\mu}}=1
$$

Its physical significance is that, for an electric field, it forms a surface of equal potential. This is based on the fact that equipotential surfaces should always be perpendicular to the electric field lines. The constant-$\mu$ lines, being ellipses, satisfy this condition: their tangent directions are aligned with the external bisectors of angles formed by lines connecting the two foci, and they are perpendicular to the tangent directions of the hyperbolic electric field lines, which correspond to the internal bisectors.

Next, we determine an inverse transformation. For a point in the first quadrant with coordinates $(x, z)$, the distances to the two foci are:

$$
r_{+}=\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}\quad,\quad r_{-}=\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}
$$

Thus, the semi-major axis lengths of the ellipse and hyperbola are respectively:

$$
r_{+}+r_{-}=2a\mathrm{ch}\mu
$$

$$
r_{+}-r_{-}=2a\cos\nu
$$

These two equations help convert Cartesian coordinates into generalized coordinates $\mu$ and $\nu$. Next, we utilize the following property: the infinitesimal displacement caused by an increase in $\mu$ between equipotential surfaces is the derivative of the coordinates with respect to $\mu$:

$$
\mathrm{d}x=a\mathrm{sh}\mu\cos\nu\mathrm{d}\mu\quad,\quad\mathrm{d}z=a\mathrm{ch}\mu\sin\nu\mathrm{d}\mu
$$

We proceed to calculate the length of this displacement:

$$
\mathrm{d}s={\sqrt{\mathrm{d}x^{2}+\mathrm{d}z^{2}}}=a{\sqrt{\mathrm{ch}^{2}\mu-\cos^{2}\nu}}\mathrm{d}\mu
$$

Next, we consider the electric potential difference caused by displacements between one ellipse and another. This difference is equal to the electric field strength multiplied by the displacement length. Because the ellipses represent equipotential surfaces, this product is constant everywhere. In particular, taking $\nu=90^{\circ}$ places this point exactly on the $z$-axis, and the electric field strength at this location has already been computed in (2). We obtain the following equation:

$$
{\frac{E_{0}a^{2}}{a^{2}+a^{2}\mathrm{{sh}}^{2}\mu\sin^{2}{90^{\circ}}}}\cdot a\mathrm{{ch}}\mu\mathrm{{d}}\mu=E\cdot a{\sqrt{\mathrm{{ch}}^{2}\mu-\cos^{2}\nu}}\mathrm{{d}}\mu
$$

This gives the distribution of electric field strength. To determine the direction of electric field lines, we only need to locate the bisector of the angle formed by lines connecting the two foci:

$$
\theta={\frac{\theta_{+}+\theta_{-}}{2}}
$$

$$
\tan\theta_{\pm}={\frac{z}{x\pm a}}
$$

We organize the result:

$$
f(x,z)={\frac{2a^{2}}{\left[{\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}}+{\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}}\right]^{2}}}\left[\left[{\frac{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}}\right]^{\frac{1}{4}}+\left[{\frac{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}}\right]^{\frac{1}{4}}\right]~.
$$

With $z=0$, $x=r$, we obtain:

$$
f(r)=\frac{2a^{2}}{(r+a+|r-a|)\sqrt{|r^{2}-a^{2}|}}
$$

For the electric field, a charged circular disk with radius $a$ is required to generate it. In this case, the field strength at $r<a$ is:

$$
E=E_{0}f(r)={\frac{E_{0}a}{\sqrt{a^{2}-r^{2}}}}
$$

By symmetry and Gauss's law:

$$
E=\frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_{0}}
$$

Thus, the surface charge density on the disk is:

$$
\boxed{\sigma=\frac{2\varepsilon_{0}E_{0}a}{\sqrt{a^{2}-r^{2}}}}
$$","$$
\boxed{\sigma=\frac{2\varepsilon_{0}E_{0}a}{\sqrt{a^{2}-r^{2}}}}

133,MECHANICS,"A particle undergoes planar motion, where the $x$ component of its velocity $v_{x}$ remains constant. The radius of curvature at this moment is $R$. Determine the acceleration at this moment.","To solve for the radius of curvature, it's more appropriate to use the natural coordinate system. In this coordinate system, the tangential and normal components of acceleration are represented as:

$$
a_{\tau} = {\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}}, \quad a_{n} = {\frac{v^{2}}{R}}.
$$

Also, 

$$
v_{x} = v \cos\theta,
$$

where $\theta$ can be referenced in Figure 1.5. If we take the time derivative of equation (2) and consider that $v_{x}$ is a constant, we get:

$$
{\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}} = v {\dot{\theta}} \tan\theta.
$$

Since $\dot{\theta} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}s} \frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{v}{R}$, where $s$ is the arc length coordinate, substituting this relation into equation (3) gives:

$$
a_{\tau} = {\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}} = {\frac{v^{2}}{R}} \tan\theta.

From equations (1), (2), and (4), the magnitude of the particle's acceleration can be expressed as:

The central axes of both the circular cylinder and the elliptical cylinder are horizontal. The magnitude of gravitational acceleration is $g$. The circular cylinder is fixed and cannot rotate. Initially, the elliptical cylinder is in equilibrium at the bottom of the circular cylinder with its minor axis aligned vertically. Assuming the elliptical cylinder undergoes rolling without slipping inside the circular cylinder, derive the frequency $f$ of the small oscillations of the elliptical cylinder's center of mass near this equilibrium position.","The radius of curvature at the contact point is  

$$
\rho_{1}=\frac{a^{2}}{b}
$$  

Thus, in geometric terms, it can be equivalent to a cylinder whose center of mass is offset by $(\rho_{1}-b)$. Let the angle between the contact point and the cylinder center line be $\theta$, and the self-rotation angle of the elliptical cylinder be $\varphi$.

No-slip rolling gives  

$$
R\theta=\rho_{1}(\theta+\varphi)

$$

$$

The moment of inertia of the elliptical cylinder about its central axis is

88,MODERN,"In a certain atom $A$, there are only two energy levels: the lower energy level $A_{0}$ is called the ground state, and the higher energy level $A^{\star}$ is called the excited state. The energy difference between the excited state and the ground state is $E_{0}$. When the atom is in the ground state, its rest mass is $m_{0}$; when it is in the excited state, due to its intrinsic instability, it will transition to the ground state while emitting photons externally. It is known that the probability of transition from the excited state to the ground state in unit time in the atom's rest reference frame is $\lambda$, and the probability of emitting photons in all directions is equal. At the initial moment, the total number of atoms is $N_{0}(N_{0}\gg1)$, and the experimental reference frame $S$ and the atom's proper reference frame $S^{\prime}$ are time-synchronized. All $N_{0}$ atoms are in the excited state and have a common velocity $\pmb{v}$ in the $+\hat{\pmb{x}}$ direction relative to the $S$ frame.

Considering $m_{0}c^{2}\gg E_{0}$, at this time the recoil effect on the atom due to photon emission can be ignored. Try to solve the angular distribution of the light emission power $w(\theta)$ from the atom at time $\pmb{t}$ in the laboratory reference frame $S$. (Calculate the emission power per unit solid angle in the direction of angle $\pmb{\theta}$ relative to the $+\hat{\pmb{x}}$ axis, rather than the received power at an infinite distance. The speed of light in vacuum is $c$ (known). The answer should be expressed using $\lambda, N_0, E_0, v, \theta, \pi, t, c$. Please check and output the final answer.","Consider the reference frame $S^{\prime}$:

$$
h\nu_{0}=E_{0}
$$  

Let the remaining number of atoms at time $t^{\prime}$ be $N^{\prime}$:

$$
-\mathrm{d}N^{\prime}=\lambda N^{\prime}\mathrm{d}t^{\prime}
$$  

Solving for $N^{\prime}$, we get:

$$
N^{\prime}=N_{0}e^{-\lambda t^{\prime}}

The total power emitted by photons:

$$

$$  

Using the relations:

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{d}E_{l i g h t}=P\mathrm{d}t}\ {\mathrm{d}E_{l i g h t}^{\prime}=P^{\prime}\mathrm{d}t^{\prime}}\end{array}
$$  

We obtain:

$$
P=P^{\prime}=\lambda N_{0}E_{0}e^{-\lambda\frac{\epsilon}{\gamma}}
$$  

Where:

$$
\gamma={\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-{\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}
$$  

Considering that number density is Lorentz invariant, let the number of photons emitted in $S$, within $\theta \sim \theta + \mathrm{d}\theta$, be $\dot{n}$.  

From the transformation of the photon energy and momentum, the relationship between $\pmb\theta^{\prime}$ and $\pmb\theta$ can be expressed as:

$$
\dot{n}\mathrm{d}t\times2\pi\sin\theta\mathrm{d}\theta=\frac{\dot{N}^{\prime}}{4\pi}\mathrm{d}t^{\prime}\times2\pi\sin\theta^{\prime}\mathrm{d}\theta^{\prime}
$$  

$$
\cos\theta^{\prime}=\frac{\cos\theta-\beta}{1-\beta\cos\theta}
$$  

And the transformation of time:

$$
\mathrm{d}t^{\prime}=\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}\mathrm{d}t
$$  

Substituting into the equations, we get:

$$
\dot{n}=\frac{\dot{N}^{\prime}}{4\pi}\cdot\frac{\mathrm{d}\cos\theta^{\prime}}{\mathrm{d}\cos\theta}\cdot\frac{\mathrm{d}t^{\prime}}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{\dot{N}^{\prime}}{4\pi}\cdot\frac{(1-\beta^{2})^{\frac{3}{2}}}{(1-\beta\cos\theta)^{2}}

Considering the frequency transformation of photons:

$$
\nu=\frac{\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}}{1-\beta\cos\theta}\nu_{0}

We further obtain the power distribution of the emitted light:

$$
w={\frac{\mathrm{d}P}{\mathrm{d}\Omega}}={\dot{n}h\nu}={\frac{P}{4\pi}}{\frac{(1-\beta^{2})^{2}}{(1-\beta\cos\theta)^{3}}}={\frac{\lambda N_{0}E_{0}}{4\pi}}{\frac{(1-\beta^{2})^{2}}{(1-\beta\cos\theta)^{3}}}\cdot e^{-\lambda{\frac{4}{7}}}

In the relativistic framework, $\beta = \frac{v}{c}$ (where $v$ is the velocity and $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum). Replacing $\beta$ and $\lambda$ with velocity-related quantities, the formula becomes:

Following the position where the charge density term appears, add the divergence term of the magnetic field and the curl term of the electric field, we obtain:

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\boldsymbol{\nabla\cdot E}=\rho}\ {\boldsymbol{\nabla\times E}=\lambda\frac{k}{c}-\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{B}}{\partial t}}\ {\boldsymbol{\nabla\cdot B}=\omega}\ {\boldsymbol{\nabla\times B}=\frac{1}{c}\boldsymbol{j}+\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial E}{\partial t}}\end{array}

The conservation of magnetic charge implies:  

$$
\frac{\partial\omega}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{k}=0

Since the curl of the electric field does not have divergence, the identity is obtained:   

$$
\lambda\frac{\nabla\cdot\pmb{k}}{c}-\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial\nabla\cdot\pmb{B}}{\partial t}=0

The coefficient of restitution between the rods is $e = 0$. For convenience, assume that forces between the rods only occur at the instant of collision, and are otherwise negligible.  Assume there are infinitely many rods, all initially standing upright. At a certain moment, a disturbance is applied to the first rod, causing it to fall with a certain initial angular velocity.

If a positive ion with a mass of $m$ and a charge of $q$ is placed near the origin, and it is restricted to move only within the $xy$ plane, and somehow all four charged lines are made to rotate counterclockwise around the origin with an angular velocity $\Omega$, with the angular velocity vector directed along the $z$-axis, given that the vacuum permittivity is $\varepsilon_{0}$, find the minimum value of $\Omega$, denoted as $\Omega_{\min}$, required for the ion to maintain stable equilibrium near the origin.","Near the origin, the electric potential can be expressed as  $$ \begin{array}{r l} U&=-\displaystyle\frac\lambda{2\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\ln\displaystyle\frac{\sqrt{(a-x)^{2}+y^{2}}}{a}-\displaystyle\frac\lambda{2\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\ln\displaystyle\frac{\sqrt{(a+x)^{2}+y^{2}}}{a}\\ &+\displaystyle\frac\lambda{2\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\ln\displaystyle\frac{\sqrt{x^{2}+(a-y)^{2}}}{a}+\displaystyle\frac\lambda{2\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\ln\displaystyle\frac{\sqrt{x^{2}+(a+y)^{2}}}{a}\end{array} $$  Using the formula given in the problem, it can be considered that $x\cdot y$ are both small quantities, thus we have  $$ \begin{array}{r l}         \frac{\lambda}{2\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\ln{\frac{\sqrt{(a-x)^{2}+y^{2}}}{a}} & =\frac{\lambda}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\ln\frac{a^{2}-2a x+x^{2}+y^{2}}{a^{2}}                                                                      \\                                                                                  & =\frac{\lambda}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\ln\left(1+{\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}-2a x}{a^{2}}}\right)                                                           \\                                                                                  & =\frac{\lambda}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\left[{\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}-2a x}{a^{2}}}-{\frac{1}{2}}\left({\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}-2a x}{a^{2}}}\right)^{2}\right] \\                                                                                  & =\frac{\lambda}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\left({\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}-2a x}{a^{2}}}-{\frac{2x^{2}}{a^{2}}}\right)                                         \\                                                                                  & =\frac{\lambda\left(-x^{2}+y^{2}-2a x\right)}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}a^{2}}     \end{array} $$  By proceeding similarly, we obtain the approximate results of the other terms, thus we have  $$ {\begin{array}{r l}\\&{U(x,y)=-{\frac{\lambda\left(-x^{2}+y^{2}-2a x\right)}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}a^{2}}}-{\frac{\lambda\left(-x^{2}+y^{2}+2a x\right)}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}a^{2}}}}\\ &{\qquad+{\frac{\lambda\left(x^{2}-y^{2}-2a y\right)}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}a^{2}}}+{\frac{\lambda\left(x^{2}-y^{2}+2a y\right)}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}a^{2}}}}\\ &{\qquad={\frac{\lambda\left(x^{2}-y^{2}\right)}{\pi\varepsilon_{0}a^{2}}}}\end{array}} $$  After obtaining the electric potential, we can find the components of the electric field intensity along the $x$ and $y$ directions, obtaining  $$ {\begin{array}{r}{E_{x}=-{\cfrac{\partial U(x,y)}{\partial x}}=-{\cfrac{2\lambda x}{\pi\varepsilon_{0}a^{2}}}}\ {E_{y}=-{\cfrac{\partial U(x,y)}{\partial y}}={\cfrac{2\lambda y}{\pi\varepsilon_{0}a^{2}}}}\end{array}} $$  Therefore, the equation of motion for the positive ion is  $$ \begin{array}{l}{{m{\ddot{x}}+\displaystyle\frac{2q\lambda}{\pi\varepsilon_{0}a^{2}}x=0}}\ {{m{\ddot{y}}-\displaystyle\frac{2q\lambda}{\pi\varepsilon_{0}a^{2}}y=0}}\end{array} $$  It is obvious that in the $x$ direction it is stable, whereas in the $y$ direction it is unstable.

367,MECHANICS,"There is a smooth elliptical track, and the equation of the track satisfies $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ ($a > b > 0$). On the track, there is a small charged object that can move freely along the track, with mass $m$ and charge $q$. Now, a point charge with charge $Q$ (same sign as $q$) is placed at the origin. Find the period $T$ of the small oscillations of the charged object around its stable equilibrium position.","It is evident that at this point, the small object is in a stable equilibrium position at the two vertices of the major axis of the elliptical orbit. When the small object experiences a slight deviation along the orbit from the stable equilibrium position, as shown in the figure below, the distance from the small object to the origin O is \( r \), and the angle relative to the x-axis is \( \theta \) (\( \theta << 1 \)).

From the elliptical orbit equation, differentiating both sides, we have:
\[ \frac{2x dx}{a^2} + \frac{2y dy}{b^2} = 0 \]

This leads to the elliptic tangent slope at the point:
\[ \tan \alpha = \frac{a^2}{b^2} \tan \theta \]

The angle between the direction of the electrostatic force on the small object and the normal is:
\[ \beta = \alpha - \theta \]

Since the distance of the small object deviating from the stable equilibrium position is very small, we have \(\theta, \alpha, \beta << 1\), which implies:
\[ \beta = \alpha - \theta \approx \left( \frac{a^2}{b^2} - 1 \right) \theta \]

Magnitude of the electrostatic force on the small object:
\[ F = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{Qq}{r^2} \]

Where \( r \) satisfies:
\[ \frac{r^2 \cos^2 \theta}{a^2} + \frac{r^2 \sin^2 \theta}{b^2} = 1 \]

Thus, we obtain:
\[ r = \sqrt{\frac{a^2 b^2}{b^2 + (a^2 - b^2) \sin^2 \theta}} = a \left[ 1 + \frac{a^2 - b^2}{b^2} \sin^2 \theta \right]^{-\frac{1}{2}} \approx a \left[ 1 + \frac{a^2 - b^2}{b^2} \theta^2 \right]^{\frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ \approx a \left( 1 - \frac{a^2 - b^2}{2b^2} \theta^2 \right) \]

And the tangential component of the electrostatic force:
\[ F_t = -F \sin \beta \approx -\frac{Qq}{4\pi \epsilon_0 a^2} \left( 1 - \frac{a^2 - b^2}{2b^2} \theta^2 \right)^{-2} \cdot \left( \frac{a^2}{b^2} - 1 \right) \theta \]
\[ \approx -\frac{Qq (a^2 - b^2)}{4\pi \epsilon_0 a^2 b^2} \theta \]

Velocity of the small object:
\[ v = \dot{r} + r \dot{\theta} = -\frac{a (a^2 - b^2)}{2b^2} 2 \theta \dot{\theta} + a \left( 1 - \frac{a^2 - b^2}{2b^2} \theta^2 \right) \dot{\theta} \approx a \dot{\theta} \]

\[ F_t = m a_t = m \dot{v} = m a \ddot{\theta} \]

\[ ma \ddot{\theta} = -\frac{Qq (a^2 - b^2)}{4\pi \epsilon_0 a^2 b^2} \theta \]

There is a uniform spring with a spring constant of \(k\) and an original length of \(L\), with a mass of \(m\). One end is connected to a wall, and the other end is connected to a mass \(M\) block, placed on a horizontal smooth surface for simple harmonic motion. It is known that \(m \ll M\).

The spring, after being used for a long time, experiences corrosion, causing the spring constant to decrease and the mass to increase. It is approximately assumed that the spring constant and mass uniformly increase or decrease throughout the spring.

A new spring initially has an amplitude of \(A_0\). After a period of time, the spring mass becomes \(\gamma_1\) times its original mass, and the spring constant becomes \((1 - \gamma_2\frac{m}{M})\) times its original value. Under the following model, find the change in amplitude \(\Delta A\).

Assume that the additional mass added to the spring during corrosion moves at the same speed as the spring, meaning the added mass has the same velocity as the point where it is added.

---","First, based on the analysis of the change in the system's mechanical energy, through the integration of energy relationships and separation of variables, the relationship between the energy ratio and the stiffness coefficient as well as mass is obtained:  
\(\ln\frac{E}{E_0} = \frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{k'}{k} + \frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{M'}{M_0'}\), taking the exponential on both sides gives \(\frac{E}{E_0} = \sqrt{\frac{k'}{k}\frac{M'}{M_0'}}\).  
From \(E = \frac{1}{2}k'A^2\) and \(E_0 = \frac{1}{2}kA_0^2\), it follows that \(\frac{\frac{1}{2}k'A^2}{\frac{1}{2}kA_0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{k'}{k}\frac{M'}{M_0'}}\).  
Substituting \(k' = (1 - \gamma_2\frac{m}{M})k\), \(M' = M + \frac{1}{3}\gamma_1 m\), \(M_0' = M + \frac{1}{3}m\), and approximating using \(m \ll M\):  
\(\frac{A^4}{A_0^4} = \frac{M + \frac{1}{3}\gamma_1 m}{M + \frac{1}{3}m} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \gamma_2\frac{m}{M}} \approx \left(1 + \frac{\gamma_1 - 1}{3}\frac{m}{M}\right)\left(1 + \gamma_2\frac{m}{M}\right) \approx 1 + \left(\frac{\gamma_1 - 1}{3} + \gamma_2\right)\frac{m}{M}\).  
Expanding \(A^4 \approx A_0^4\left[1 + \left(\frac{\gamma_1 - 1}{3} + \gamma_2\right)\frac{m}{M}\right]\) to the fourth root gives \(A \approx A_0\left[1 + \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{\gamma_1 - 1}{3} + \gamma_2\right)\frac{m}{M}\right]\).  
Thus, the change in amplitude \(\Delta A = A - A_0\) is:  
\[
\Delta A = \frac{m A_0}{4M}\left[\frac{1}{3}(\gamma_1 - 1) + \gamma_2\right]
\]","\[
\Delta A = \frac{m A_0}{4M}\left[\frac{1}{3}(\gamma_1 - 1) + \gamma_2\right]

284,OPTICS,"Fiber-optic communication has greatly advanced our information technology development. Below, we will briefly calculate how the light carrying information propagates through a rectangular optical fiber. Consider a two-dimensional waveguide (uniform in the direction perpendicular to the paper), extending along the $x$ direction, with variations in refractive index in the $y$ direction. The middle layer is called the core, with a thickness of $b$ and refractive index $n$; the top and bottom layers are called the cladding, with a refractive index of $n+\delta n$. Assume the light entering the fiber is a monochromatic wave with a wavelength of $\lambda$.

When reflecting at the waveguide interface, the light transitioning from $n_{1}$ to $n_{2}$ has a reflection coefficient:

$$
r={\frac{n_{1}\cos\theta_{1}-n_{2}\cos\theta_{2}}{n_{1}\cos\theta_{1}+n_{2}\cos\theta_{2}}}
$$  

where $\theta_1$ is the angle of incidence and $\theta_2$ is the angle of refraction. According to theoretical calculations, determine the phase shift $\varphi$ of the light after its first reflection, given that the angle of incidence is $\theta$, assuming total internal reflection occurs. Assume the plane wave phase is $\omega t-kx$.","Considering that the optical signal should propagate without loss, the light transmission in the optical fiber should involve total internal reflection at the interface. Assume the incident electric field is represented by ${\widetilde{E}}_{i}$, and the reflected electric field by $\widetilde{E}_{r}$; we have $\widetilde{E_{r}}=r\cdot\widetilde{E_{i}}$. By substituting Snell's law  

$$
n_{1}\sin\theta_{1}=n_{2}\sin\theta_{2}
$$  

into the expression for the reflection coefficient, we obtain:  

$$
r={\frac{n_{1}\cos\theta_{1}-{\sqrt{{n_{2}}^{2}-{n_{1}}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta_{1}}}}{n_{1}\cos\theta_{1}+{\sqrt{{n_{2}}^{2}-{n_{1}}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta_{1}}}}}
$$  

Total internal reflection condition (no loss) requires:  

$$
n_{2}\leqslant n_{1}\sin\theta_{1}
$$  

Thus, the reflection coefficient can be expressed in the form of a complex number:  

$$
r={\frac{n_{1}\cos\theta_{1}-j{\sqrt{{n_{1}}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta_{1}-{n_{2}}^{2}}}}{n_{1}\cos\theta_{1}+j{\sqrt{{n_{1}}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta_{1}-{n_{2}}^{2}}}}}={\frac{{n_{1}}^{2}\cos2\theta+{n_{2}}^{2}}{{n_{1}}^{2}-{n_{2}}^{2}}}-j{\frac{2n_{1}\cos\theta_{1}{\sqrt{{n_{1}}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta_{1}-{n_{2}}^{2}}}}{{n_{1}}^{2}-{n_{2}}^{2}}}

$$
\varphi=2\arctan\left[{\frac{\sqrt{\sin^{2}\theta_{1}-\left(n_{2}/n_{1}\right)^{2}}}{\cos\theta_{1}}}\right]

Based on symmetry, select the cone vertex as the origin, and establish spherical coordinates $(R,\alpha,\theta)$ to solve the spatial electric field potential distribution.

71,ELECTRICITY,"Given a particle with charge $q$ and mass $m$ moving in an electric field $\pmb{E}=E_{x}\pmb{x}+E_{z}\pmb{z}$ and a magnetic field $\pmb{B}=B\pmb{z}$. The initial conditions are: position $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ and velocity $(v_{\perp}\cos\delta,v_{\perp}\sin\delta,v_{z})$.

We know that a particle in a uniform magnetic field undergoes circular Larmor gyration, and the center of this rotation is called the guiding center. The drift velocity of this guiding center due to the electric field can be expressed using $\pmb{E},\pmb{B}$ and their magnitudes.

Problem: We discuss the case where the magnetic field is uniform, but the electric field is non-uniform. For simplicity, we assume $\pmb{E}$ is in the $\pmb{x}$ direction and varies sinusoidally in the $\pmb{y}$ direction.

$$
\pmb{E} \equiv E_{0}\cos(k y)\hat{\pmb{x}}
$$

In reality, such a charge distribution can occur in a plasma during wave propagation. Find the corresponding guiding center drift velocity. It is known that the electric field is very weak, and the particle's initial position is $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$. Approximate to the lowest order that can distinguish from the uniform electric field case.","This problem has been modified; the original problem had four questions.

If there is an electric field present, we find that the motion of the particle will be a combination of two movements: the normal circular Larmor gyration and a drift towards the center of guidance. We can choose the $\pmb{x}$ axis along the direction of $\pmb{E}$, so $\pmb{E}_{y}=0$, and the velocity components related to transverse components can be treated separately. The equation of motion is  

$$
m{\frac{d v}{d t}}=q({\pmb{E}}+v\times{\pmb{B}})
$$  

Its $\pmb{z}$ component is  

$$
\frac{d v_{z}}{d t}=\frac{q}{m}E_{z}
$$  

Integrating yields  

$$
v_{\tau}=\frac{q E_{z}}{m}t+v_{z0}
$$  

This is a simple motion along the direction of $\pmb{B}$. The transverse components of the previous equation are  

$$
\frac{d\upsilon_{x}}{d t}=\frac{q}{m}E_{x}\pm\omega_{c}\upsilon_{y}
$$  

$$
\frac{d\upsilon_{y}}{d t}=0\pm\omega_{c}\upsilon_{x}
$$  

where $\omega_{c}\equiv{\frac{|g|B}{m}}$ is the Larmor gyration angular frequency. Differentiating these two equations gives  

$$
\ddot{v}_{x}=-\omega_{c}^{2}v_{x}
$$  

$$
\ddot{v}_{y}=-\omega_{c}^{2}(v_{y}+\frac{E_{x}}{B})
$$  

We can rewrite the above equations as  

$$
\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}(v_{y}+\frac{E_{x}}{B})=-\omega_{c}^{2}(v_{y}+\frac{E_{x}}{B})
$$  

Therefore, if we use $\begin{array}{r}{v_{y}+\frac{E_{x}}{B}}\end{array}$ instead of ${\pmb v_{\pmb y}}$, the equation simplifies to the situation when the electric field is zero. Thus, the two equations can be replaced by  

$$
v_{x}=v_{\perp}e^{i(\omega_{\mathrm{e}}t+\delta)}
$$  

$$
\upsilon_{y}=-i\upsilon_{\perp}e^{i(\omega_{c}t+\delta)}-\frac{E_{x}}{B}
$$  

where $\delta$ is the angle between the component of the particle's initial velocity in the $_{xy}$ plane ${\pmb v}_{\bot}$ and the $\pmb{x}$ axis (counter-clockwise direction). Further integration and taking the real part yields the equations of motion  

$$
x=x_{0}+\frac{v_{\perp}}{\omega_{c}}\sin(\omega_{c}t+\delta)
$$  

$$
y=y_{0}-\frac{E_{x}}{B}t+\frac{v_{\perp}}{\omega_{c}}[1-\cos(\omega_{c}t+\delta)]
$$  

$$
z=\frac{q E_{z}}{2m}t^{2}+v_{z0}t+z_{0}
$$  

From the equations of motion, it is observed that the Larmor motion of the particle is identical to the case without an electric field, but there is a drift superimposed in the $-y$ direction towards the center of guidance ${\pmb v}_{{\pmb g}{\pmb c}}$ (for $E_{z}>0)$.

To obtain the general formula for ${\pmb v}_{{\pmb g}{\pmb c}}$, we can solve the equation (1) using vector form. Since we already know that the term $\textstyle m{\frac{d v}{d t}}$ only gives rise to circular motion with frequency $\omega_{c}$, this term can be ignored in equation (1). Thus, equation (1) becomes  

$$
\pmb{{ E}}+\pmb{{\upsilon}}\times\pmb{{ B}}=0
$$  

By taking the cross product of $\pmb{B}$ with the above expression, we get  

$$
\pmb{E}\times\pmb{B}=\pmb{B}\times(\pmb{v}\times\pmb{B})=\pmb{v}\pmb{B}^{2}-\pmb{B}(\pmb{v}\cdot\pmb{B})
$$  

The transverse component of this equation is  

$$
v_{\perp q c}=E\times B/B^{2}\equiv v_{E}
$$  

We define this transverse component as $\pmb{v}_{E}$, which is the electric field drift towards the center of guidance.

The equation of motion for the particle is  

$$
m{\frac{d{\boldsymbol{v}}}{d t}}=q[{\boldsymbol{E}}({\boldsymbol{y}})+{\boldsymbol{v}}\times{\boldsymbol{B}}]
$$  

Decomposing into scalar form, we have  

$$
\dot{v}_{x}=\frac{q B}{m}v_{y}+\frac{q}{m}E_{x}(y)
$$  

$$
\dot{v}_{y}=-\frac{q B}{m}v_{x}
$$  

Simplifying yields  

$$
\ddot{\upsilon}_{x}=-\omega_{c}^{2}\upsilon_{x}\pm\omega_{c}\frac{\dot{E}_{x}(y)}{B}
$$  

$$
\ddot{v}_{y}=-\omega_{c}^{2}v_{y}-\omega_{c}^{2}\frac{E_{x}(y)}{B}
$$  

Here, $\pmb{E_{x}}(\pmb{y})$ is the electric field at the particle's location. To compute this value, we need to know the particle's trajectory, which is precisely what we attempt to solve initially. If the electric field is weak, as a first approximation, we can estimate $E_{x}(y)$ using the undisturbed trajectory.

The trajectory in the absence of an electric field is given by  

$$
y=y_{0}\pm r_{L}\cos\omega_{c}t
$$  

where $\begin{array}{r}{r_{L}=\frac{m v_{\perp}}{|q|B}}\end{array}$ is the Larmor gyration radius, and we obtain  

$$
\ddot{v}_{y}=-\omega_{c}^{2}v_{y}-\omega_{c}^{2}\frac{E_{0}}{B}\cos k(y_{0}\pm r_{L}\cos\omega_{c}t)
$$  

We seek a solution that is the sum of the gyration at $\omega_{c}$ and a stationary drift $_{v_{E}}$. Since we are interested in expressing $v_{E}$, we can average over one cycle to eliminate the gyration motion. Thus, the equation yields  

$$
\bar{v}_{x}=0
$$  

In the above equation, the average of the oscillating term $\ddot{v}_{y}$ is clearly zero, giving us  

$$
\overline{{\ddot{v}}}_{y}=0=-\omega_{c}^{2}\overline{{v}}_{y}-\omega_{c}^{2}\frac{E_{0}}{B}\overline{{\cos k(y_{0}\pm r_{L}\cos\omega_{c}t)}}
$$  

Upon expanding the small approximation and averaging, we find  

$$
\overline{{v}}_{y}=-\frac{E_{x}(y_{0})}{B}(1-\frac{1}{4}k^{2}r_{L}^{2})
$$  

Thus, due to non-uniformity, the usual $\pmb{{E}}\times\pmb{{B}}$ drift is modified to  

$$
\boxed{v_{E}={\frac{E\times B}{B^{2}}}(1-{\frac{1}{4}}{(k \frac{m v_{\perp}}{\vert{q}\vert B})}^2)}
$$  

The correction term represents the finite Larmor radius effect under the sinusoidal electric field distribution.","$$
v_E = \frac{E \times B}{B^2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{4} \left(k \frac{m v_\perp}{|q| B}\right)^2 \right)

716,MECHANICS,"The principle of a rotational speed measurement and control device is as follows. At point O, there is a positive charge with an electric quantity of Q. A lightweight, smooth-walled insulating thin tube can rotate around a vertical axis through point O in the horizontal plane. At a distance L from point O inside the tube, there is a photoelectric trigger control switch A. A lightweight insulating spring with a free length of L/4 is fixed at the O end, and the other end of the spring is connected to a small ball with mass m and positive charge q.  Initially, the system is in static equilibrium. The thin tube rotates about a fixed axis under the action of an external torque, allowing the small ball to move within the thin tube. When the rotational speed $\omega$ of the thin tube gradually increases, the small ball reaches point A in the thin tube and just achieves radial equilibrium relative to the thin tube, triggering the control switch. The external torque instantaneously becomes zero, thus limiting excessive rotational speed; at the same time, the charge at point O becomes an equal amount of negative charge -Q. By measuring the position B of the radial equilibrium point of the small ball relative to the thin tube thereafter, the rotational speed can be determined. If the distance OB is measured to be $L/2$, determine the rotational speed $\omega$ of the thin tube when the ball is at point B.  Express the result using the following physical quantities: Electric charge $Q$, ball's electric charge $q$, mass $m$, length $L$, and Coulomb's constant $k$.
","Let the angular velocity of the thin tube be $\omega_A$. When the small ball is in equilibrium at point A relative to the thin tube, we have:  $$ k_0 \cdot \frac{3}{4}L - \frac{k q Q}{L^2} = m L \omega_A^2 \tag{1} $$  When the small ball is in equilibrium at point B ($OB = L/2$), with angular velocity $\omega_B$, we have:  $$ k_0 \cdot \frac{1}{4}L + \frac{k q Q}{L^2 / 4} = \frac{L}{2} m \omega_B^2 \tag{2} $$  Conservation of angular momentum gives:  $$ m L^2 \omega_A = m \cdot \frac{L^2}{4} \omega_B \tag{3} $$  From this, we obtain:  $$ \omega_B = 4 \omega_A $$  Substituting the above into equation (2):  $$ k_0 \cdot \frac{1}{4}L + \frac{k q Q}{L^2 / 4} = 8 L m \omega_A^2 \tag{4} $$  Simultaneously solving equations (1) and (4), we find the spring constant:  $$ k_0 = \frac{48 k q Q}{23 L^3} \tag{5} $$  Substituting equation (5) into equation (2), we can find the angular velocity of the thin tube at this time:  $$ \omega_B = 4 \sqrt{ \frac{13 k q Q}{23 m L^3} } \tag{6} $$

Additionally, if $m$ is even, ${n}$ is odd, and $n = m + 3$, there is a thermal resistance $R$ between node $m$ and node $n$. Find the equivalent thermal resistance $R_{04}$ between node 0 and node 4 when all other nodes remain adiabatic.","Noticing that it can be arranged in a zigzag pattern, the diagram is shown above:

First, consider $R_{02}$, which is relatively simple. Due to symmetry, the two nodes divide the network into two parts, each side being equivalent to $\scriptstyle{R^{\prime}}$. The self-similarity of $\scriptstyle{R^{\prime}}$ provides the equivalence shown on the right of the diagram above. Therefore, the 35 resistors are also $\scriptstyle{R^{\prime}}$, leading to:

Discarding the negative root gives:

$$

Thus:

$$

By treating $\scriptstyle{R^{\prime}}$ as equivalent to the series connection of $\scriptstyle{R^{\prime}-R}$ and $\scriptstyle{R}$, the equivalent network between 0123 is shown in the lower-left diagram above. Consequently:

$$
R_{01}=(R^{\prime}-R)//(R^{\prime}-R+R+R)

The speed of light in a vacuum is $c$, and the reduced Planck constant is $\hbar = h / (2\pi)$.

If a bound pair is stable in the ground state $n=1$, the maximum value of $\alpha$, $\alpha_{c}$, can be calculated.

To bombard $\mathrm{X_{2}}$ and separate $\mathrm{X}$, neglecting the rest mass and utilizing a particle with ultra-high speed and energy $E$, the experimental setup involves bombarding $\mathrm{X_{2}}$ at rest in the laboratory frame $\mathrm{L}$. Set $\alpha = \alpha_{c}/2$.

Consider a droplet of water being flung off the surface of the sphere, and then follows a trajectory under the influence of gravity.

If the angular velocity is too small, water droplets cannot be flung off the top, so there's a minimum angular velocity $\omega_{1}$.

When the angular velocity $\omega>\omega_{1}$, there is still a region on the sphere where droplets cannot be normally flung off. Find the equation of the curve projecting the boundary of this region onto the $xy$-plane (express this as an equation involving $y^2$ in terms of $x$).","Take the $x$-axis as the polar axis, and the $z$-axis as the reference axis for the azimuthal angle, i.e.:

498,OPTICS,"The interference phenomenon in variable refractive index systems is a new issue of concern in the field of optics in recent years. There is a thin film of non-dispersive variable refractive index medium with a constant thickness \(d\), where the refractive index within the film changes linearly with the distance from the film's surface. The refractive index at the lower surface is \(n_a\), and at the upper surface is \(n_b > n_a\). A beam of parallel light enters the film from the lower surface at an incident angle \(i\). Taking the incident point as the origin, the positive direction of the \(x\)-axis is along the lower surface of the film to the right, and the positive direction of the \(y\)-axis is perpendicular to the film surface upward.

If the incident light is monochromatic light with wavelength \(\lambda\), and the refractive index of air for this wavelength of light is \(n_0 = 1\), the distance between the incident points of two adjacent beams of incident light is \(2S\). The incident point of the first beam on the lower surface is denoted as Q, and the point from which it exits from the lower surface again after its first reflection from the upper surface is denoted as P, with OP = \(2S\). It is important to note that \(S\) is unknown and can be determined through other physical quantities; the final answer should not contain \(S\). Ignoring the phase change caused by reflection, find the phase difference \(\varphi\) between the two beams of light.","The phase difference is \(\varphi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \Delta L\), where \(\Delta L = L - L_0\).
\(L\) is the total optical path from the incident point Q through reflection to the exit point P in the medium.
\(L_0 = 2S \sin i\) is the optical path difference in air for two adjacent incident beams, which can also be understood as: if the light travels a horizontal distance \(2S\) in air (with a refractive index of 1), it is the projection of the optical path along the direction parallel to the incident light.
This definition of \(\Delta L\) describes the additional optical path difference caused by light traveling in the medium relative to traveling the same equivalent distance in air, which is often used to describe the formation of interference patterns.

1. **Calculate the optical path \(L\) in the medium**:
   We have already calculated:
   \(L = 2 \int_0^d \frac{n(y)^2}{\sqrt{n(y)^2 - \sin^2 i}} dy\)
   Substituting variables \(u = n(y) = n_a + ky\), \(dy = \frac{d}{n_b - n_a} du\).
   \(L = 2 \int_{n_a}^{n_b} \frac{u^2}{\sqrt{u^2 - \sin^2 i}} \frac{d}{n_b - n_a} du = \frac{2d}{n_b - n_a} \int_{n_a}^{n_b} \frac{u^2}{\sqrt{u^2 - \sin^2 i}} du\)
   Using the integration formula \(\int \frac{x^2 dx}{\sqrt{x^2 - A^2}} = \frac{x}{2} \sqrt{x^2 - A^2} + \frac{A^2}{2} \ln|x + \sqrt{x^2 - A^2}| + C\), where \(A = \sin i\).
   \(L = \frac{2d}{n_b - n_a} \left[ \frac{u}{2} \sqrt{u^2 - \sin^2 i} + \frac{\sin^2 i}{2} \ln(u + \sqrt{u^2 - \sin^2 i}) \right]_{n_a}^{n_b}\)
   \(L = \frac{d}{n_b - n_a} \left[ u \sqrt{u^2 - \sin^2 i} + \sin^2 i \ln(u + \sqrt{u^2 - \sin^2 i}) \right]_{n_a}^{n_b}\)
   \(L = \frac{d}{n_b - n_a} \left[ n_b\sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i} - n_a\sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i} + \sin^2 i \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right) \right]\)

2. **Calculate the horizontal displacement \(2S\)**:
   We have already calculated:
   \(2S = 2 \int_0^d \frac{\sin i}{\sqrt{n(y)^2 - \sin^2 i}} dy\)
   \(2S = 2 \sin i \int_0^d \frac{dy}{\sqrt{n(y)^2 - \sin^2 i}}\)
   \(2S = 2 \sin i \left[ \frac{d}{n_b - n_a} \int_{n_a}^{n_b} \frac{du}{\sqrt{u^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right]\)
   \(2S = \frac{2d \sin i}{n_b - n_a} \left[ \ln(u + \sqrt{u^2 - \sin^2 i}) \right]_{n_a}^{n_b}\)
   \(2S = \frac{2d \sin i}{n_b - n_a} \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right)\)

3. **Calculate the optical path difference \(L_0\) in air**:
   \(L_0 = 2S \sin i\)
   \(L_0 = \left[ \frac{2d \sin i}{n_b - n_a} \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right) \right] \sin i\)
   \(L_0 = \frac{2d \sin^2 i}{n_b - n_a} \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right)\)

4. **Calculate the total optical path difference \(\Delta L\)**:
   \(\Delta L = L - L_0\)
   \(\Delta L = \frac{d}{n_b - n_a} \left[ n_b\sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i} - n_a\sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i} + \sin^2 i \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right) \right] - \frac{2d \sin^2 i}{n_b - n_a} \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right)\)
   \(\Delta L = \frac{d}{n_b - n_a} \left[ n_b\sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i} - n_a\sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i} + (\sin^2 i - 2\sin^2 i) \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right) \right]\)
   \(\Delta L = \frac{d}{n_b - n_a} \left[ n_b\sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i} - n_a\sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i} - \sin^2 i \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right) \right]\)

5. **Calculate the phase difference \(\varphi\)**:
   \(\varphi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \Delta L\)
   \[ \varphi = \frac{2\pi d}{\lambda (n_b - n_a)} \left[ n_b\sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i} - n_a\sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i} - \sin^2 i \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right) \right] \]
   Or written in the form of arccosh:
   \[ \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right) = \text{arccosh}\left(\frac{n_b}{\sin i}\right) - \text{arccosh}\left(\frac{n_a}{\sin i}\right) \]
   Therefore:
   \[ \varphi = \frac{2\pi d}{\lambda (n_b - n_a)} \left[ n_b\sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i} - n_a\sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i} - \sin^2 i \left( \text{arccosh}\left(\frac{n_b}{\sin i}\right) - \text{arccosh}\left(\frac{n_a}{\sin i}\right) \right) \right] \]

Final answer:
The phase difference \(\varphi\) between the two beams is:
\[ \varphi = \frac{2\pi d}{\lambda (n_b - n_a)} \left[ n_b\sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i} - n_a\sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i} - \sin^2 i \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right) \right] \]",\[ \varphi = \frac{2\pi d}{\lambda (n_b - n_a)} \left[ n_b\sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i} - n_a\sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i} - \sin^2 i \ln \left( \frac{n_b + \sqrt{n_b^2 - \sin^2 i}}{n_a + \sqrt{n_a^2 - \sin^2 i}} \right) \right] \]

If the width of the double slits is $d$ and the horizontal distance from the screen to the double slits is $L$. Use a filter to filter out the light with a wavelength of $\lambda_{1}$. Due to the broadening of the spectral line caused by the thermal motion of molecules in the sodium lamp, if the temperature of the sodium lamp is $T$ and the mass of the sodium atom is $m$, try to calculate the position where the fringes become blurred for the first time. Assume that the sodium atoms follow the Maxwell velocity distribution law (and that the problem can be solved using the far-field condition).","Examine the effect of monochromatic light on the screen:  $$  U = U_0 \left( e^{i k \cdot \frac{d x}{L}} + 1 \right) $$  The resulting light intensity is:  $$  I = U \cdot U^* = U_0^2 \left(2 + 2\cos\left(k \cdot \frac{d x}{L}\right)\right) = I_0 \left(1 + \cos\left(k \cdot \frac{d x}{L}\right)\right) $$  For Doppler frequency shift due to thermal motion, examine the Doppler effect of electromagnetic waves:  $$  \frac{k}{k_0} = \frac{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}{1 - \beta \cos\theta} \approx 1 + \beta \cos\theta = 1 + \frac{v_x}{c} \quad $$  For particles with horizontal velocity in the interval $v - v + \mathrm{d}v$ (in terms of emitted light intensity), we have:  $$  \frac{\mathrm{d}I}{I_0} = f_x(v) \, \mathrm{d}v \quad $$  For light intensity on the screen:  $$  I  \propto \int f_x(v)\,\mathrm{d}v \cos\frac{k_0 \left(1 + \frac{v_x}{c}\right) d x}{L}\ = \int f_x(v)\,\mathrm{d}v \left( \cos\frac{k_0 d x}{L}\cos\frac{v k_0 d x}{L c}\ - \sin\frac{k_0 d x}{L}\sin\frac{v k_0 d x}{L c} \right) \quad  $$  Notice that the second term is an odd function, and its integral equals 0. The integral of the first term is calculated as:  $$  s_1 = \operatorname{Re} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \sqrt{\frac{m}{2\pi k T}} e^{- \frac{m v^2}{2k T} + i \frac{v k_0 d x}{L c}} \, \mathrm{d}v =  e^{\frac{\frac{k_0 d x^2}{L c}}{\frac{2m}{k T}}} \quad $$  When it decreases to $\frac{1}{e}$, the background light will become blurred, thus:  $$  \frac{\frac{k_0 d x^2}{L c}}{\frac{2m}{k T}} = 1 \quad $$  Solve for:  $$  x = \sqrt{\frac{2m}{k T}} \cdot \frac{L c \lambda_2}{2\pi d} \quad $$","$$

In the following discussion, we do not consider relativistic effects or retarded potentials.  Uniformly charged rings with radius $R$ are placed on planes $z=l$ and $z=-l$ in space, respectively.

The magnetic moment $\overrightarrow{M}$ of the ions is usually proportional to the spin vector, ${\overrightarrow{M}} = \gamma{\overrightarrow{S}}$, where $\gamma(>0)$ is a constant. The spin-spin interaction between ions $i$ and $j$ is usually the Heisenberg interaction, $-J_{i,j}\vec{S}_{i} \cdot \vec{S}_{j}$. Under a static uniform external magnetic field $\overrightarrow{B}$, the total energy (Hamiltonian) of the system is typically given by $\begin{array}{r}{H = -\sum_{(i,j)}J_{i,j}\vec{S}_{i}\cdot\vec{S}_{j} - }\end{array}$ $\begin{array}{r}{\gamma\overrightarrow{B}\cdot\sum_{i}\overrightarrow{S}_{i}}\end{array}$.

And the rope remains horizontal. The particle moves on a smooth horizontal surface. Initially, the rope is stretched to a length of $a+b$, and then the particle is released. Determine how much time it takes for the particle to return to the original release position.","First consider \( x > a \). At this time, the particle only experiences the elastic force \( -k(x-a) \) in the horizontal direction. According to Newton's second law, the equation of motion for the particle is

$$
m{\ddot{x}} = -k(x-a),
$$

which is the equation of simple harmonic motion. To solve equation (1), make the substitution \(\xi = x - a\), then equation (1) becomes

$$
m\ddot{\xi} = -k\xi.
$$

Further, with the transformation \(\ddot{\xi} = \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}\xi}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\xi}{\mathrm{d}t} \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\xi}\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\xi}{\mathrm{d}t}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\mathrm{d}\dot{\xi}^{2}}{\mathrm{d}\xi}\), equation (2) becomes

$$
\mathrm{d}\dot{\xi}^{2} = -2\omega^{2}\xi\mathrm{d}\xi,
$$

where \(\omega = \sqrt{k/m}\). Integrating the above, and setting the initial conditions \(\xi = \xi_{0}, \dot{\xi} = v_{0} \) at \(t=0\), yields

$$
\dot{\xi}^{2} = v_{0}^{2} - \omega^{2}(\xi^{2} - \xi_{0}^{2}) = (v_{0}^{2} + \omega^{2}\xi_{0}^{2}) - \omega^{2}\xi^{2},
$$

which implies

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}\xi}{\mathrm{d}t} = \pm\sqrt{(v_{0}^{2} + \omega^{2}\xi_{0}^{2}) - \omega^{2}\xi^{2}} = \pm\omega\sqrt{A^{2} - \xi^{2}},
$$

where \({\cal A} = \sqrt{\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{\omega^{2}} + \xi_{0}^{2}}\). Further integration and considering the initial conditions gives

$$
\xi = A\sin(\pm\omega t + \arcsin \frac{\xi_{0}}{A}) = A\cos(\omega t + \alpha),
$$

where \(\alpha = \pm\arcsin{\frac{\xi_{0}}{A}} \mp {\frac{\pi}{2}}\). Thus, the general solution of equation (1) is

$$
x = a + A\cos(\omega t + \alpha).
$$

According to the problem, at \(t=0\), \(x=a+b, \dot{x}=0\). Substituting into equation (3) determines the constants of integration to be \(A=b, \alpha=0\). Substituting back into equation (3), we obtain

$$
x = a + b\cos\omega t.
$$

This shows that the motion of the particle in the domain \(x > a\) is periodic. The time for the particle to move from \(x = a + b\) to \(x = a\) and back is the period, which is

$$
t_{0} = {\frac{1}{2}}\frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}.
$$

When \(x < -a\), the particle experiences an elastic force of \(-k(x+a)\) in the horizontal direction. Note that because \(x < -a\), \( -(x+a) > 0\), so the elastic force points in the positive \(x\) direction, which is consistent with the actual situation. The equation of motion is

$$
m{\ddot{x}} = -k(x+a).
$$

Using a similar method to the above, the general solution of the equation is

$$
x = -a + B\cos(\omega t + \beta),
$$

where \(B, \beta\) are constants of integration. According to analysis in \(\textcircled{2}\), \(\dot{x}|_{x=a} = \dot{x}|_{x=-a}\), we determine \(B=b\). Equation (5) indicates that the motion of the particle in the region \(x < -a\) is also simple harmonic, with the same frequency as in the region \(x > a\). The time for the particle to move from \(x=-a\) to \(x=-(a+b)\) and back is also \(t_{0}\).

In summary, the total time taken for the particle to move from \(x = a + b \) to \(x = a\) and from \(x = -a\) to \(x = -(a + b)\) and back is

$$
t_{1} = 2t_{0} = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}.
$$

The previous discussion also shows that considering just \(x > a\) is sufficient to determine the characteristics of the particle's motion in the interval \(|x| > a\), especially concerning the motion's time.

\(\textcircled{2}\) When \(|x|<a\), i.e., \(-a<x<a\), the particle is not subject to any external force in the horizontal direction, and thus will move uniformly with the velocity it has at \(x = \pm a\). The speed of the particle at \(x = a\) is

$$
\dot{x}|_{x=a} = \dot{x}|_{t=t_{1}} = -b\omega = -b\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
$$

The time for the particle to travel from \(x=a\) to \(x=-a\) and back to \(x=a\) is

$$
t_{2} = 4\frac{a}{|\dot{x}|_{x=a}|} = \frac{4a}{b}\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}.
$$

The process for the particle to return to its release point is \(x = a+b \rightarrow x = a \rightarrow x = 0 \rightarrow x = -a \rightarrow x = -(a+b) \rightarrow x = -a \rightarrow x = 0 \rightarrow x = a \rightarrow x = a+b\), so the total time experienced is

$$
t = t_{1} + t_{2} = 2\left(\pi + \frac{2a}{b}\right)\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}.

The bouncy ball will rotate around the planet's center while continuously bouncing off the surface.

If we take $k<1$ and the launch angle $\theta$ to be a small amount and make reasonable approximations, find the total angle $\varphi$ that the bouncy ball rotates around the planet's center before it stops bouncing on the ground and rolls around the surface.","The two components of the initial throw speed are:

$$
v_{r}=k v_{0}\sin\theta\quad,\quad v_{\theta}=k v_{0}\cos\theta
$$  

Based on the symmetry of the starting and landing points with respect to the major axis of the elliptical orbit, and combining the definition of the restitution coefficient under the conditions of a smooth ground. When the object undergoes the $(m+1)$-th segment of projectile motion, the two velocity components at the surface are generally:

$$
v_{m r}=\varepsilon^{m}k v_{0}\sin\theta\quad,\quad v_{m\theta}=k v_{0}\cos\theta
$$  

Using the celestial body's angular momentum formula, we can obtain its semi-latus rectum $p$:

$$
L=m\sqrt{G M p}
$$  

$$
L=m v_{m\theta}R
$$  

Using the mechanical energy formula of the celestial body, we can obtain its orbital semi-major axis $A$:

$$
E=-{\frac{G M m}{2A}}
$$  

$$
E=\frac{1}{2}m\left(v_{m r}^{2}+v_{m\theta}^{2}\right)-\frac{G M m}{R}
$$  

The first cosmic velocity is:

$$
v_{0}={\sqrt{\frac{G M}{R}}}
$$  

Finally, the orbital eccentricity is determined, and the standard equation is written as:

$$
r=\frac{p}{1-e\cos\varphi}\quad,\quad p=(1-e^{2})A
$$  

The reason for choosing the denominator as negative is because we use the highest point of the orbit rather than the periapsis direction as the polar axis direction in polar coordinates. The calculation yields:

$$
r={\frac{k^{2}R\cos^{2}\theta}{1-{\sqrt{(1-k^{2}\cos^{2}\theta)^{2}+\varepsilon^{2m}k^{4}\sin^{2}\theta\cos^{2}\theta}}}}\cos\varphi
$$  

To calculate the angle turned around the Earth's center during each projectile motion, take $r=R$, and obtain:

$$
\cos\varphi={\frac{1-k^{2}\cos^{2}\theta}{\sqrt{(1-k^{2}\cos^{2}\theta)^{2}+\varepsilon^{2m}k^{4}\sin^{2}\theta\cos^{2}\theta}}}
$$  

Thus, the positive and negative acute solutions of $\varphi$ represent the angle turned. Additionally, converting the equation above into arctangent gives the rotation angle for this process:

$$
\Delta\varphi_{m}=2\arctan\frac{\varepsilon^{m}k^{2}\sin\theta\cos\theta}{1-k^{2}\cos^{2}\theta}

Geometric series:

$$
\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\varepsilon^{m}={\frac{1}{1-\varepsilon}}

Because under optical conditions, the light frequency $\omega$ is often smaller than the plasma frequency $\omega_{p}=\sqrt{n e^{2}/\varepsilon_{0}m}$, it can be found that the corresponding equivalent relative permittivity of the metal is a negative real number. 

If a plane electromagnetic wave at this frequency, with a relative permittivity $\varepsilon_{1}>1$ for the dielectric, enters the metal (which at this frequency has an equivalent relative permittivity $\varepsilon_{2}<0$) with a wavevector $k_{x}=\alpha$, $k_{y}=-\mathrm{i}\beta$ ($\alpha$ and $\beta$ are real numbers), the electric field lies in the $xy$ plane, and the interface is defined as the $y=0$ plane, with the positive $y$-axis pointing from the dielectric towards the metal, there exists a specific horizontal wavevector $k_{x}$ such that no reflected light is generated. Instead, a unique optical mode satisfying Maxwell’s equations is formed solely by the incident and refracted light—this corresponds to the surface plasmon polariton mode. 

However, in this problem, we need to consider the case where the metal actually has a relative complex permittivity $\widetilde{\varepsilon}_{2}=\varepsilon_{21}+\mathrm{i}\varepsilon_{22}$, where $\varepsilon_{21}<0$ and the imaginary part $\varepsilon_{22}$ is a small quantity. Under these conditions, the surface plasmon polariton mode not only propagates but also attenuates. Please express the wavelength $\lambda$ of the surface plasmon polariton mode in terms of the dielectric relative permittivity $\varepsilon_{1}$, the metal’s relative complex permittivity, and the vacuum wavelength $\lambda_{0}$. Approximate to the lowest order.","The magnetic field strength in the $z$ direction is tangentially continuous:

$$
H_{1z}=H_{2z}=H
$$

According to Maxwell's equations:

$$
\nabla\times\pmb{H}=\varepsilon\frac{\partial\pmb{E}}{\partial t}
$$

Furthermore, since the electric field is tangentially continuous:

$$
E_{1x}=E_{2x}
$$

The relationship obtained is:

$$
\frac{k_{1y}}{\varepsilon_{1}}=\frac{-\mathrm{i}\beta_{1}}{\varepsilon_{1}}=\frac{\mathrm{i}\beta_{2}}{\varepsilon_{2}}=\frac{k_{2y}}{\varepsilon_{2}}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{r}{k_{1}^{2}=\alpha^{2}-\beta_{1}^{2}=\varepsilon_{1}k_{0}^{2}>0}\\ {k_{2}^{2}=\alpha^{2}-\beta_{2}^{2}=\varepsilon_{2}k_{0}^{2}<0}\end{array}
$$

Solving for $k_{1x}=k_{2x}=k_{x}=\alpha$, we find:

$$
k_{x}=\frac{\omega}{c}\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_{1}\varepsilon_{2}}{\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{2}}}
$$

Squaring the above expression and rewriting, we get:

$$
(k_{x1}+\mathrm{i}k_{x2})^{2}=k_{0}^{2}\frac{\varepsilon_{1}(\varepsilon_{21}+\mathrm{i}\varepsilon_{22})}{\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{21}+\mathrm{i}\varepsilon_{22}}\approx k_{0}^{2}\frac{\varepsilon_{1}\varepsilon_{21}}{\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{21}}\left(1+\mathrm{i}\frac{\varepsilon_{22}}{\varepsilon_{21}}\right)\left(1-\mathrm{i}\frac{\varepsilon_{22}}{\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{21}}\right)
$$

By comparing the real and imaginary parts and making approximations:

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{k_{x1}^{2}=k_{0}^{2}\displaystyle\frac{\varepsilon_{1}\varepsilon_{21}}{\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{21}}}}\\ {{2k_{x1}k_{x2}=k_{0}^{2}\displaystyle\frac{\varepsilon_{1}\varepsilon_{21}}{\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{21}}\cdot\displaystyle\frac{\varepsilon_{1}\varepsilon_{22}}{\varepsilon_{21}\left(\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{21}\right)}}}\end{array}
$$

Substituting into:

$$
k_{0}=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda_{0}}\quad,\quad k_{x1}=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\quad,\quad k_{x2}=\frac{2\pi}{d}
$$

Finally, we obtain:

$$

115,ADVANCED,"Consider a charged rod undergoing relativistic rotation. Within an infinitely long cylinder with radius $R$, positive charges with number density $n$ and charge $q$ revolve around the axis with a uniform angular velocity of $\omega$ in a relativistic motion. The original reference frame is $S$, and now we switch to a reference frame $S^{\prime}$ that moves parallel to the axis with a velocity $\beta c$ relative to frame $S$. We consider the radiation from the accelerating charges. In the relativistic case, the instantaneous outgoing radiated electromagnetic power of a charge $q$ with arbitrary velocity $\pmb{v}$ and arbitrary acceleration $\pmb{a}$ follows the Larmor formula:  
$$
P={\frac{\gamma^{6}q^{2}}{6\pi\varepsilon_{0}c^{3}}}\left[a^{2}-{\frac{(v\times a)^{2}}{c^{2}}}\right]

where $\gamma=1/\sqrt{1-v^{2}/c^{2}}$. Assume all charge radiation is incoherent. Without using energy or power transformation formulas, calculate directly the radiation power per unit length of the rod in frame $S^{\prime}$ through the charge radiation method. The speed of light in a vacuum is $c$.","Charge and current distribution:

$$
\rho=n q
$$

$$
j_{\theta}=\rho v=\Im\Im q\omega\tau
$$

Note that the above equation is valid only for $r<R$, otherwise it is zero. There is an electric field inside and outside:

There is only a magnetic field inside:

$$
E_{\mathrm{r}}(r)=\int_{0}^{\operatorname*{min}\{r,R\}}\frac{\mathrm{d}\lambda}{2\pi\varepsilon_{0}\tau}\quad,\quad\mathrm{d}\lambda=\rho(r^{\prime})\cdot2\pi r^{\prime}\mathrm{d}\tau^{\prime}
$$

The integration yields the result:

$$
\mathcal{B}_{z}(r)=\int_{r}^{R}\mu_{0}\mathrm{d}i~~~,\mathrm{d}i=j_{\theta}(r^{\prime})\cdot\mathrm{d}r^{\prime}
$$

$$
E_{\mathrm{r}}(r)={\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{{\displaystyle{\frac{n q r}{2\varepsilon_{0}}}}}&{(r<R)}\ {{\displaystyle{\frac{n q R^{2}}{2\varepsilon_{0}r}}}}&{(r>R)}\end{array}\right.}

$$
\mathcal{B}_{z}(r)=\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{\frac{\mu_{0}n q\omega(R^{2}-r^{2})}{2}}&{(r<R)}\ {0}&{(r>R)}\end{array}\right.

In a new frame of reference, the number density scales directly:

$$
n^{\prime}=\frac{n}{\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}}
$$

The radius remains unchanged:

$$
\boldsymbol{r}^{\prime}=\boldsymbol{r}
$$

But velocity acquires a new component:

$$
v_{z}^{\prime}=-\beta c
$$

The original components also change. Since one loop in the original reference frame corresponds to proper time, the angular velocity of the new helical motion becomes:

Thus, the new charge and current distribution is:

$$
v_{\theta}^{\prime}\cdot T^{\prime}=v_{\theta}T
$$

$$
T^{\prime}=\frac{T}{\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}}
$$

$$
\rho^{\prime}=\pi^{\prime}q=\frac{n q}{\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}}

$$
j_{z}^{\prime}=\rho^{\prime}v_{z}^{\prime}=-\frac{n q\beta c}{\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}}

Thus, the original two electromagnetic fields are scaled proportionally as described above:

$$
E_{r}^{\prime}(r)=\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{\displaystyle\frac{n q r}{2\varepsilon_{0}\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}}}&{(r<R)}\ {\displaystyle\frac{n q R^{2}}{2\varepsilon_{0}\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}r}}&{(r>R)}\end{array}\right.
$$

$$
B_{\natural}^{\prime}(r)=\left\{{\begin{array}{l l}{{\frac{\mu_{0}n q\omega r^{2}}{2}}}&{(r<R)}\ {0}&{(r>R)}\end{array}}\right.

However, an axial current is also produced, leading to a surrounding magnetic field, expressed as:

$$
B_{\theta}(r)=\int_{0}^{r}\frac{\mu_{0}\mathrm{d}I}{2\pi r}\quad,\quad\mathrm{d}I=j_{z}^{\prime}(r^{\prime})\cdot2\pi r^{\prime}\mathrm{d}r^{\prime}
$$

The integration yields the result:

$$
B_{\theta}^{\prime}(r)=\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{-\frac{\mu_{0}n q\beta c r}{2\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}}}&{(r<R)}\\ {-\frac{\mu_{0}n q\beta c R^{2}}{2\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}r}}&{(r>R)}\end{array}\right.

493,ELECTRICITY,"There is a uniform rigid current-carrying circular ring with mass $M$ and radius $R$, carrying a current of $I$. At a distance $h$ from the center of the ring, there is a magnetic dipole with a magnetic dipole moment of $m$, which is fixed and cannot rotate. The line connecting the magnetic dipole and the center of the ring is perpendicular to the plane of the ring. The ring can only rotate about a certain diameter axis passing through the center of the ring. Initially, the plane of the ring is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic dipole moment. Now, the ring is slightly rotated by a small angle. Find the period $T_1$ of the simple harmonic vibration of the ring after release (assuming that all parameters satisfy the stable equilibrium condition, and in the initial state, the direction of the magnetic field produced by the current on the ring at the position of the magnetic dipole is the same as that of the magnetic dipole). Given the vacuum permeability is $\mu_0$.","When the ring is rotated by an angle \( \theta \), a cylindrical coordinate system is established, and the coordinates corresponding to the position of \( \vec{m} \) are

\[
\begin{cases} 
\rho = h \sin \theta \\
z = h \cos \theta 
\end{cases}
\]

The magnetic field component \( B_z(0, z) \) is given by

\[
B_z(0, z) = \frac{\mu_0 I R^2}{2(R^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}
\]

The expression for the energy of simple harmonic motion involves the second-order term of \( \theta \), so both \( B_z \) and \( B_\rho \) are retained up to the second-order term in \( \rho \) (where \( B_{\rho,0} \), \( B_{z,1} \), and \( B_{\rho,2} \) are all zero):

\[
\begin{cases} 
B_{z,0} = B_z(0, z) = \frac{\mu_0 I R^2}{2(R^2 + z^2)^{3/2}} \\
B_{\rho,1} = -\frac{\rho}{2} \frac{\mathrm{d}B_z(0, z)}{\mathrm{d}z} = \frac{3 \mu_0 I R^2 z \rho}{4(R^2 + z^2)^{5/2}} \\
B_{z,2} = -\frac{\rho^2}{4} \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 B_z(0, z)}{\mathrm{d}z^2} = \frac{3 \mu_0 I R^2 (R^2 - 4z^2) \rho^2}{8(R^2 + z^2)^{7/2}}

\]

Using the small-angle approximation \( \sin \theta \approx \theta \) and \( \cos \theta \approx 1 - \frac{1}{2} \theta^2 \):

\[
\begin{cases} 
B_{z,0} \approx \frac{\mu_0 I R^2}{2(R^2 + h^2)^{3/2}} \left(1 + \frac{3}{2} \frac{h^2 \theta^2}{h^2 + R^2}\right) \\
B_{\rho,1} \approx \frac{3 \mu_0 I R^2 h^2 \theta}{4(R^2 + h^2)^{5/2}} \\
B_{z,2} \approx \frac{3 \mu_0 I R^2 h^2 \theta^2 (R^2 - 4h^2)}{8(R^2 + h^2)^{7/2}}
\end{cases}

The potential energy at the angular displacement \( \theta \) is

\[
W = -\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B} = -m(B_z \cos \theta + B_\rho \sin \theta) = -m(B_{z,0} \cos \theta + B_{z,2} \cos \theta + B_{\rho,1} \sin \theta)

\[
= -m \left[ \frac{\mu_0 I R^2}{2(R^2 + h^2)^{3/2}} \left(1 + \frac{3}{2} \frac{h^2 \theta^2}{h^2 + R^2}\right) \left(1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2}\right) + \frac{3 \mu_0 I R^2 h^2 \theta^2 (R^2 - 4h^2)}{8(R^2 + h^2)^{7/2}} \left(1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2}\right) + \frac{3 \mu_0 I R^2 h^2 \theta^2}{4(R^2 + h^2)^{5/2}} \right]
\]

\[
\approx -\frac{m \mu_0 I R^2}{2(R^2 + h^2)^{3/2}} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\mu_0 m I R^2 (2h^4 + 2R^4 - 11R^2 h^2)}{4(h^2 + R^2)^{7/2}} \theta^2

In the above derivation, all terms higher than the second order in \( \theta \) are neglected.

The rotational kinetic energy of the ring is

\[
K = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}MR^{2}\right)\dot{\theta}^{2}

69,MECHANICS,"In 2023, the team of astronomers led by Jerome Oros at San Diego State University in the United States released their latest research findings, discovering a new binary star system called ""Kepler-49"". Meanwhile, astronomical observations indicate that nearby planets are influenced by this binary star system, resulting in orbital precession. This problem aims to explain this phenomenon concisely.

""Kepler-49"" is a binary star system mainly composed of two stars (Saka and Juipte) with masses $M_{S}$ and $M_{J}$ (both known). Under the mutual gravitational interaction, they perform stable circular motion around the center of mass. With an angular frequency $\Omega$, the respective motion radii $R_{S}$, $R_{J}$ (unknown quantities) and the distance between them $R_{0}$ (unknown quantity) can be determined. The gravitational constant $G$ is known. 

The rotation center of the two stars is set as the origin of coordinates, and a polar coordinate system is established with the closest point as the radial distance to describe the movement of the planet. Experimental observation shows that the scale of the Saka and Juipte system is much smaller than the distance to the planet (i.e., $R_{0} \ll r$). Meanwhile, during one period of $\Omega$, the planet can be approximately considered as not moving. The modified potential energy $V_{\mathrm{eff}}$ (unknown quantity) of the planet can be determined, retaining the lowest order correction term $\delta V$.

It is known that the energy of the planet is $E < 0$, the orbital angular momentum is $\bar{L}$, and the mass is $m$. Only considering the zeroth-order term $V_{0}$ of the gravitational potential energy, the motion equation of the planet $r(\theta)$ (unknown quantity) can be determined.

Question: Consider now the form of potential energy $V = V_{0} + \delta V$ for the planet. In this case, $\vec{B}$ is no longer conserved. Solve for the orbital precession angle $\Delta{\alpha}$ (express the answer in terms of $M_{J}, M_{S}, G, \Omega, m, L$).

Hint 1: The Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector is introduced in the Kepler problem, and in this problem, it is defined as

$$
\vec{B} = \vec{v} \times \vec{L} - G(M_{J} + M_{S})m\hat{r}.
$$

Consider the planet moving only under the potential energy $V = V_{0}$, and in this case, let $\vec{B}_{0} = \vec{B}$. It can be proved that $\vec{B}_{0}$ is conserved (the proof method is unknown), and the expression for $|\vec{B}_{0}|$ can be determined (unknown quantity).

Hint 2: The precession angle is defined as the rotation angle of the closest point during a single period of the planet. Consider the LRL vector pointing to the closest point, retaining the lowest order term:

$$
\Delta\alpha = \left|\frac{\vec{B}_{0}}{|\vec{B}_{0}|} \times \left(\frac{\vec{B}}{|\vec{B}|} - \frac{\vec{B}_{0}}{|\vec{B}_{0}|}\right)\right| \approx \frac{|\vec{B}_{0} \times \Delta\vec{B}|}{|\vec{B}_{0}|^{2}}.
$$","From  

$$
\frac{G M_{J}M_{S}}{(R_{J}+R_{S})^{2}}=M_{J}R_{J}\Omega^{2}=M_{S}R_{S}\Omega^{2}
$$  

we solve  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{R_{J}=\displaystyle\frac{{M}_{S}}{{ M}_{S}+{ M}_{J}}\left(\frac{{ G}({ M}_{S}+{ M}_{J})}{\Omega^{2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}}}\ {{{}}}\ {{R_{S}=\displaystyle\frac{{ M}_{J}}{{ M}_{S}+{ M}_{J}}\left(\frac{{ G}({ M}_{S}+{ M}_{J})}{\Omega^{2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}}}\end{array}
$$  

Further  

$$
R_{0}=R_{J}+R_{S}=\left({\frac{G(M_{S}+M_{J})}{\Omega^{2}}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
$$  

As stated in the problem, during a single period of rotation of the binary system, it is approximately assumed that the planet's position does not change; at time $t$, the potential energy is  

$$
V=-{\frac{G M_{J}m}{\sqrt{r^{2}+R_{J}^{2}-2r R_{J}\cos\left(\Omega t-\varphi_{0}\right)}}}-{\frac{G M_{S}m}{\sqrt{r^{2}+R_{S}^{2}+2r R_{S}\cos\left(\Omega t-\varphi_{0}\right)}}}
$$  

Expand the gravitational potential in a power series in $\scriptstyle{\frac{R_{0}}{r}}$:  

$$
V=-{\frac{G M_{J}m}{r}}\left(1+\cos\left(\Omega t-\varphi_{0}\right){\frac{R_{J}}{r}}+{\frac{3\cos^{2}\left(\Omega t-\varphi_{0}\right)-1}{2}}{\frac{R_{J}^{2}}{r^{2}}}\right)\ldots
$$  

$$
\ldots-{\frac{G M_{s}m}{r}}\left(1-\cos\left(\Omega t-\varphi_{0}\right){\frac{R_{s}}{r}}+{\frac{3\cos^{2}\left(\Omega t-\varphi_{0}\right)-1}{2}}{\frac{R_{s}^{2}}{r^{2}}}\right)
$$  

Consider the time-averaged result and retain the lowest-order correction term, yielding $V_{\mathbf{eff}}$:  

$$
V_{\mathrm{eff}}={\bar{V}}={\frac{\Omega}{2\pi}}\int_{0}^{\frac{2\pi}{n}}V\mathrm{d}t=V_{0}+\delta V=-{\frac{G(M_{J}+M_{S})m}{r}}-{\frac{G M_{J}M_{S}m}{4(M_{J}+M_{S})}}\cdot{\frac{R_{0}^{2}}{r^{3}}}
$$  

When considering only the zero-order term of the potential energy  

$$
V_{0}(r)=-\frac{G(M_{S}+M_{J})m}{r}
$$  

For $\pmb{E}<\mathbf{0}$, the planet is on an elliptical orbit; provided without proof (to be memorized as fundamental knowledge):  

$$
e=\sqrt{1+\frac{2E L^{2}}{G^{2}(M_{S}+M_{J})^{2}m^{3}}}
$$  

$$
p={\frac{L^{2}}{G(M_{J}+M_{S})m^{2}}}
$$  

As stated in the problem, taking the position near the center as the polar radius, we solve  

$$
r(\theta)=\frac{\frac{L^{2}}{G(M_{J}+M_{S})m^{2}}}{1+\sqrt{1+\frac{2E L^{2}}{G^{2}(M_{S}+M_{J})^{2}m^{3}}}\cos\theta}
$$  

(4)  

Considering the form of the potential energy at this time  

$$
V=V_{0}=-\frac{G(M_{J}+M_{S})m}{r}
$$  

$\vec{B}$ conservation equivalently means it does not change over time. Consider the conservation of angular momentum  

$$
{\frac{\mathrm{d}{\vec{B}}}{\mathrm{d}t}}={\frac{1}{m}}({\vec{F}}\times L)-G(M_{J}+M_{S})m{\dot{\theta}}{\hat{\theta}}={\frac{1}{m}}\cdot{\frac{G(M_{J}+M_{S})m}{r^{2}}}\cdot m r^{2}{\dot{\theta}}{\hat{\theta}}-G(M_{J}+M_{S})m{\dot{\theta}}{\hat{\theta}}=0
$$  

For computational convenience, select the special position where the planet is near the center at $\theta=0$:  

$$
\vec{B}_{0}=\frac{L^{2}(1+e)}{p}-G(M_{J}+M_{S})m\hat{r}=G(M_{J}+M_{S})m\sqrt{1+\frac{2E L^{2}}{G^{2}(M_{S}+M_{J})^{2}m^{3}}}\hat{r}
$$  

where $\hat{r}$ is the direction of the planet near the center.  

(5)  

From the above derivation, we know that in the case where only the zero-order term of the potential energy is considered, $\vec{B}$ is conserved and its direction points to the near-center point. Since $\vec{B}$ reflects information about the orbit's shape and orientation, consider the calculation of $\Delta\vec{B}$ at this time  

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{1}{m}(\vec{F}\times L)-G(M_{J}+M_{S})m\dot{\theta}\hat{\theta}=-\frac{1}{m}\frac{\partial(\delta V)}{\partial r}\hat{r}\times\vec{L}=\frac{3G M_{J}M_{S}m}{4(M_{J}+M_{S})}\cdot\frac{R_{0}^{2}}{r^{2}}\dot{\theta}\hat{\theta}
$$  

Integrate over a single period  

$$
\Delta\vec{B}=\int_{0}^{T}\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}\cdot\mathrm{d}t=\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{3G M_{J}M_{S}m}{4(M_{J}+M_{S})}\cdot\frac{R_{0}^{2}}{r^{2}}\mathrm{d}\theta\hat{\theta}
$$  

For the lowest-order correction term, use the elliptical orbit equation obtained in (3):  

$$
r={\frac{p}{1+e\cos\theta}}
$$  

$$
\Delta\vec{B}=\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{3G M_{J}M_{S}m R_{0}^{2}}{4(M_{J}+M_{S})}\cdot\frac{(1+e\cos\theta)^{2}}{p^{2}}(-\sin\theta\hat{x}+\cos\theta\hat{y})\mathrm{d}\theta=\frac{3G M_{J}M_{S}m R_{0}^{2}}{2(M_{J}+M_{S})}\cdot\frac{e\pi}{p^{2}}\hat{y}
$$  

Using the hint in the problem  

$$

65,ELECTRICITY,"In the upper half-space, there is a uniform magnetic field with magnitude \( B \) directed vertically upwards, and the ground is sufficiently rough.

Now, there is a solid insulating sphere with uniformly distributed mass \( m \) and radius \( R \) . On its surface at the equator, there are 3 mutually orthogonal wires with negligible mass and thickness and a unit length resistance of \( \lambda \). These wires are connected at the intersection point. The sphere is placed on the ground so that the circular surface formed by one of the wires is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. It is known that the sphere's center has acquired a velocity \( v_0 \) in the horizontal plane, and its initial angular velocity is such that it is in a pure rolling state. What is the subsequent change in velocity?","By noticing that the cutting of the magnetic field by the wire induces an electromotive force, which in turn generates Ampere force and torque, the motion state of the sphere changes. Now, due to the completeness of the circuit, the magnitude of the Ampere force is zero, and we only need to consider torque. Since the magnetic field here is uniform, the problem is to determine the magnetic moment $\mu$.  

We use a fundamental yet concise method to solve this problem: we move to the rest frame of the sphere to analyze the problem, and establish the coordinate system as shown in the figure. In this frame, the magnetic field appears to rotate. It should be noted that the focus here is on solving the current distribution. This change of frame is purely mathematical and does not involve relativistic effects.  

Below, we only consider the variation of the magnetic field in the $\pmb{x}$ direction, denoted as $\dot{B_{x}}$, while the variations in the $y/z$ directions are analyzed analogously. Since the relationships between electromotive force, current, and magnetic moment are linear, superposition can be performed in the end! Here, due to the symmetry introduced by the circuit, the electromotive forces and resistances for the eight mesh loops in the front and back are exactly the same, meaning all the loop equations for each mesh are identical. This results in no current through the cross-shaped wires in the center.   

Only the circular arcs perpendicular to the ${\pmb x}$ direction have current, with the electromotive force given by:

$$
\varepsilon=-\pi R^{2}\dot{B_{x}}
$$  

Thus, the current is:

$$
I={\frac{\varepsilon}{2\pi R\lambda}}
$$  

The $\pmb{\mathscr{x}}$ component of the total magnetic moment is:

$$
\mu_{x}=I S=-\frac{\pi R^{3}}{2\lambda}\dot{B_{x}}
$$  

Therefore, the total magnetic moment is:

$$
\vec{\mu}=-\frac{\pi R^{3}}{2\lambda}\dot{\vec{B}}
$$  

In the rest frame, the magnetic field rotates at an angular velocity of $-\alpha$ (referring to the angular velocity of the sphere's rotation). Hence, $\dot{\vec{B}}=-\vec{\omega}\times\vec{B}$. In the ground frame, we arrive at a remarkably elegant result:

$$
\vec{\mu}=\frac{\pi\mathcal{R}^{3}}{2\lambda}\vec{\omega}\times\vec{B}
$$  

This result is remarkably coincidental and symmetric, allowing us to utilize a simple vector method for mechanical analysis. Following the coordinate system established in the first question:

The theorem of the motion of the center of mass is:

$$
m{\frac{d{\vec{v}}}{d t}}={\vec{f}}
$$  

Rotational motion law:

$$
\frac{2}{5}m R^{2}\frac{d\vec{\omega}}{d t}=R\vec{n}\times\vec{f}+\vec{\mu}\times\vec{B}
$$  

Pure rolling constraint:

$$
\vec{v}+R\vec{\omega}\times\vec{n}=0
$$  

By taking the cross product with $\vec{n}$ on both sides of the rotational motion law, we get:

$$
\frac{2}{5}m R^{2}\frac{d\vec{n}\times\vec{\omega}}{d t}=-R\vec{f}+\frac{\pi R^{3}}{2\lambda}\vec{n}\times\left[\left(\vec{B}\cdot\vec{\omega}\right)\vec{B}-B^{2}\vec{\omega}\right]
$$  

Noting that $\vec{n}\times\vec{B}=0$, the second term on the right-hand side of the above equation is omitted. Substituting the pure rolling constraint yields:

$$
\frac{2}{5}m\frac{d\overrightarrow{v}}{d t}=-\overrightarrow{f}-\frac{\pi R B^{2}}{2\lambda}\overrightarrow{v}
$$  

Combining the theorem of the motion of the center of mass:

Direct integration gives:

$$
\frac{7m}{5}\frac{d\overrightarrow{v}}{d t}=-\frac{\pi R B^{2}}{2\lambda}\overrightarrow{v}
$$  

$$
\vec{v}=\vec{v_{0}}e^{-\frac{5\pi R B^{2}}{14m\lambda}t}
$$  

This result indicates that while the direction of velocity of the sphere does not change, its magnitude continually decreases.","$$

Find the magnitude of  \( m'  \). (It is known that the magnetic moment  \( m  \) has a magnetic induction field distribution in space as:  \( \mathbf{B}={ \frac{ \mu_{0}m}{4 \pi r^{3}}}{ \left(2 \cos \theta \mathbf{e}_{r}+ \sin \theta \mathbf{e}_{ \theta} \right)} \)),"Based on symmetry, the form is definitely on the line connecting with the center of the sphere. As shown in the figure, assume  \(m' \) is at a height  \(r' \) above point O, in the downward direction  \( \boldsymbol{r^{ \prime}} \) (if the direction is upward, the calculated value of  \(m \) would be negative).  The normal component of the magnetic induction intensity on the surface of a superconductor is zero, allowing us to calculate the normal component of the magnetic field at points P and Q.

709,MECHANICS,"In a zero-gravity space, there is a ring made of a certain material, with a radius of $R$, density $\rho$, Young's modulus $E$, and a circular cross-section with a radius of $r$ ($r \ll R$). The center of the ring is stationary in a rotating reference frame with an angular velocity $\Omega$, and the normal of the ring is in the same direction as $\Omega$. $\Omega$ is much smaller than the natural frequency of the ring's vibration. A perturbation is applied, causing vibrations on the ring. Considering a standing wave solution of order $m$, it is known that the antinodes of the standing wave will precess. Find the precession angular velocity $\delta\omega$. The positive direction is defined to be the same as $\Omega$.  Ignore motion perpendicular to the plane of the ring; the order $m$ indicates that the displacement has the form of $\cos(m\theta)$ or $\sin(m\theta)$.

The isobaric heat capacity of the system in the arbitrary case is exactly: $$

The scale factor is a state-independent dimensionless constant, and
To determine the entropy change $$S_D-S_A$$ of the D state compared to the A state, two states $$A,D$$ on the $$p-v$$ graph are chosen, knowing that $$p_{A}$$,$$v_{A}$$,$$T_{A}$$,$$p_{D}$$,$$v_{D}$$ and that the entropy change of the D state compared to the A state is $$S_D-S_A$$.
","First of all

$$
\alpha={\frac{1}{v}}\left({\frac{\partial v}{\partial T}}\right)_{p}={\frac{3}{T}}
$$

The equation of state can be obtained

$$
v=T^{3}h(p)
$$

Write the full differential of entropy and utilize Maxwell's relation:

$$
d S={\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}}d T+{\frac{\partial S}{\partial p}}d p
$$

$$
\frac{\partial S}{\partial p}=-\frac{\partial v}{\partial T}=-3T^{2}h
$$

During adiabatic process $$ d S=0$$

$$
{\frac{d p}{d T}}={\frac{\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}}{3T^{2}h}}}
$$

And the adiabatic process is

$$
p v^{2}=T^{6}p h^{2}=C
$$

The logarithmic differentiation yields

$$
\frac{d p}{d T}=-\frac{6p h}{T(h+2p h^{\prime})}
$$

Comparing the two derivatives gives

$$
\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}=-\frac{18T p h^{2}}{h+2p h^{\prime}}}
$$

Due to the properties of full differentiation, the two partial derivatives continue to conform to

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial p}\left(-\frac{18T p h^{2}}{h+2p h^{\prime}}\right)=\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\left(-3T^{2}h\right)
$$

Get the differential equation

$$
\left({\frac{3p h^{2}}{h+2p h^{\prime}}\right)^{\prime}=h
$$

Simplify it like this

$$
h=\left[\frac{3p h^{3}}{(p h^{2})^{\prime}}\right]^{\prime}=-3p h^{3}\cdot\frac{(p h^{2})^{\prime\prime}}{[(p h^{2})^{\prime}]^{2}}}+3\ frac{(p h^{2})^{\prime}h+p h^{2}h^{\prime}}{(p h^{2})^{\prime}}
$$

$$
{\frac{(p h^{2})^{\prime}}{p h^{3}}}\cdot h={\frac{(p h^{2})^{\prime}}{p h^{2}}}=-3{\frac{(p h^{2})^{\prime\prime}}{(p h^{2})^{\prime}}}}}+ 3{\frac{(p h^{2})^{\prime}}{p h^{2}}}}+3{\frac{h^{\prime}}{h}}}
$$

The solution is

$$
(p h^{2})^{-2/3}(p h^{2})^{\prime}=C h=C p^{-1/2}\cdot(p h^{2})^{1/2}
$$

Further moving the right-hand side $(p h^{2})^{1/2}$ to the left-hand side and integrating over $P$ finally yields

$$
h={\frac{1}{C_{1}{\sqrt{p}}({\sqrt{p}}+C_{2})^{3}}}}
$$

And thus the final equation of state

$$
T=C_{1}^{\frac{1}{3}}p^{\frac{1}{6}}(\sqrt{p}+C_{2})v^{\frac{1}{3}}
$$

Since the isobaric heat capacity is  

$$
c_{P}=T{\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}}
$$  

Substituting gives the result  

$$
c_{P}=-{\frac{18T^{2}p h^{2}}{h+2p h^{\prime}}}}={\frac{6T^{2}}{C_{1}({\sqrt{p}}+C_{2})^{2}}}}
$$  

Since  

$$
v=T^{3}\cdot{\frac{1}{C_{1}{\sqrt{p}}({\sqrt{p}}+C_{2})^{3}}}}
$$  

Substituting the relationship yields  

$$
\lambda=6\left(1+{\frac{C_{2}}{\sqrt{p}}}\right)
$$  

In order to make $\lambda$ constant we deduce that  

$$
C_{2}=0
$$  

Thus, only  

Since $$ C_{2}=0 $$ the previous conclusion reduces to  

$$
\lambda=6
$$  

Since $C_{2}=0$ simplifies to

$$
h={\frac{1}{C_{1}p^{2}}}
$$

$$
T^{3}=C_{1}p^{2}v
$$

$$
d S=\frac{6T}{C_{1}p}d T-\frac{3T^{2}}{C_{1}p^{2}}d p
$$

Thus, according to the equation of state

$$
C_{1}=\frac{3T_A^{3}}{p_{A}v_{A}^2}
$$

$$
\left({\frac{T_{D}}{T_{A}}}\right)^{3}=\left({\frac{p_{D}}{p_{A}}}\right)^{2}\left({\frac{v_{D}}}{v_{A}}}\right)
$$

Get

$$
T_{D}=T_{A}\left(\frac{p_D^2v_{D}}{p_A^2v_{A}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
$$

The entropy integral gives

$$
S={\frac{3T^{2}}{C_{1}p}}+C^{\prime}=3{\sqrt{\frac{T v}{C_{1}}}}+C^{\prime}
$$

Since the third law of thermodynamics

$$
C^{\prime}=0\quad,\quad S=\frac{3T^{2}}{C_{1}p}
$$

Thus entropy changes

$$
S_{D}-S_{A}={\frac{3T_{D}^{2}}{C_{1}p_{D}}}-{\frac{3T_{A}^{2}}{C_{1}p_{A}}}=\frac{3p_Av_A}{T_A}\left(\left(\frac{p_Dv_D^2}{p_Av_A^ 2}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}-1\right)

The lower surface of the piston is parallel to the bottom surface of the container. The exterior of the container is a vacuum, and the interior contains a diatomic ideal gas with the mass of a single molecule being $m$ and the total number of molecules $N$. The temperature of the gas throughout the container is uniform at $T_{0}$. 

Slowly sprinkle a total mass of powder $(p_{1}-p_{0})S/g$ onto the piston. Neglect all friction, and consider the effect of gravity on the distribution of gas molecules. Find the final temperature of the gas inside the container, $T_{1}$.","In equilibrium in a gravitational field, the molecular number density at temperature $T$ follows the Boltzmann distribution:

$$
n(z) = n_{0} \exp\left(-\frac{m g z}{k T}\right)
$$

In the formula, $n_{0}$ is the molecular number density at $z=0$ (the bottom of the container), which is an unknown to be determined; $k$ is the Boltzmann constant. The total number of molecules in the container remains constant, always equal to $N$:

$$
N = \int_{0}^{H} S n(z) \operatorname{d}z = S n_{0} \int_{0}^{H} \exp\left(-\frac{m g z}{k T}\right) \operatorname{d}z = \frac{S n_{0} k T}{m g} \left[1 - \exp\left(-\frac{m g H}{k T}\right)\right]
$$

Since the system is adiabatic and the powder is spread slowly, it can be assumed that the gas inside the container undergoes a quasi-static adiabatic process. At any moment during the process, let the temperature of the gas inside the container be $T$, the pressure at the lower surface of the piston inside the container be $p$, and the height from the lower surface of the piston to the bottom of the container be $H$. According to the first law of thermodynamics, for the gas inside the container, we have

$$
-p S \mathrm{d}H = \frac{5}{2}N k \mathrm{d}T + \mathrm{d}E_{p}
$$

In this formula, $\frac{5}{2}N k \mathrm{d}T$ represents the increase in internal energy of a diatomic ideal gas, and $\mathrm{d}E_{p}$ is the increase in gravitational potential energy of the gas in the container. Taking $z=0$ as the zero point of gravitational potential energy, we have

$$
\begin{array}{l}{E_{p} = \int_{0}^{H} m g z S n(z) \mathrm{d}z = m g S n_{0} \int_{0}^{H} z \exp\left(-\frac{m g z}{k T}\right) \mathrm{d}z } \\ { = -k T S H n_{0} \exp\left(-\frac{m g H}{k T}\right) + k T S n_{0} \cdot \frac{k T}{m g} - k T S n_{0} \exp\left(-\frac{m g H}{k T}\right) \cdot \frac{k T}{m g}} \end{array}
$$

At the lower surface of the piston, according to the ideal gas pressure formula, we have

$$
p = n(H) \cdot k T = n_{0} \exp\left(-\frac{m g H}{k T}\right) k T
$$

Substituting into equation $\textcircled{4}$ gives

$$
E_{p} = -p S H + (p S + N m g) \frac{k T}{m g} - p S \frac{k T}{m g} = -p S H + N k T
$$

Here, $p + \frac{N m g}{S} = n_{0} k T$ is the pressure at the bottom of the container. Taking the differential of the above equation gives $\mathrm{d}E_{p} = -p S \mathrm{d}H - S H \mathrm{d}p + N k \mathrm{d}T$, substituting into equation $\textcircled{3}$ gives

$$
S H \mathrm{d}p = \frac{7}{2} N k \mathrm{d}T
$$

Combining equations $\textcircled{2}$ and $\textcircled{5}$ gives

$$
H = \frac{k T}{m g} \ln\frac{p S + N m g}{p S}

Substituting into equation $\textcircled{7}$ gives

$$

According to piston equilibrium, initial state $T = T_{0}$, $p = p_{0}$, final state $T = T_{1}$, $p = p_{1}$, integrating the above equation gives

$$
\frac{p_{1} S}{N m g} \ln\left(1 + \frac{N m g}{p_{1} S}\right) - \frac{p_{0} S}{N m g} \ln\left(1 + \frac{N m g}{p_{0} S}\right) + \ln\frac{p_{1} S + N m g}{p_{0} S + N m g} = \frac{7}{2} \ln\frac{T_{1}}{T_{0}}

Let us first consider the translation of a fixed rectangular shape with ${\Delta p,\Delta V=W/\Delta p}$ in the $\mathcal{P}V$ diagram. Clearly, minimizing the heat absorbed requires minimizing the values of the center's $p,V$.Thus, it becomes optimal only when the rectangle is translated so that the $(p_0, V_0)$ point is at the upper-right corner of the rectangle:

121,MODERN,"Two spacecraft are traveling in a space medium that is flowing uniformly at a constant velocity $u$ with respect to an inertial frame $S$. The spacecraft are moving through the medium with equal relative velocities $v$ with respect to the medium. Neither of the velocities is known. Ultimately, the velocities of the two spacecraft with respect to the inertial frame $S$ are $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$, and the angle between the directions of these velocities is an acute angle $\alpha$. These three quantities are given. The speed of light is $c$. Considering relativistic effects, determine the minimum possible value of $u$.","First, let's derive a byproduct of velocity transformation. The velocity transformation is:

$$
 v_{x}^{\prime}={\frac{v_{x}-u}{1-u v_{x}/c^{2}}}
$$

$$
v_{y,z}^{\prime}=v_{y,z}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{1-u^{2}/c^{2}}}{1-u v_{x}/c^{2}}
$$

Hence, we can calculate:

$$
  \begin{array}{l}{\gamma=\cfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-(v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}+v_{z}^{2})/c^{2}}}}\ {=\cfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-(v_{x}^{\prime2}+v_{y}^{\prime2}+v_{z}^{\prime2})/c^{2}}}}\end{array}
$$

Obtain the transformation:

$$
  \gamma^{\prime}=\gamma\cdot\frac{1-{u v_{x}}/{c^{2}}}{\sqrt{1-{u^{2}}/{c^{2}}}}
$$

The minimum value of $v$ can be calculated by first determining the relative velocity of two planes:

$$
  \gamma_{12}=\frac{1-\beta_{1}\beta_{2}\cos\alpha}{\sqrt{(1-\beta_{1}^{2})(1-\beta_{2}^{2})}}
$$

Consider a system where two spaceships have equal but opposite velocities, this velocity $v=\beta c$ is what we seek. At this moment, the relative velocity of the two planes can be obtained:

Thus, jointly obtain:

$$
  \gamma_{12}=\frac{1+\beta^{2}}{\sqrt{(1-\beta^{2})(1-\beta^{2})}}=\frac{1+\beta^{2}}{1-\beta^{2}}
$$

$$
v=c{\sqrt{\frac{c^{2}-v_{1}v_{2}\cos\alpha-{\sqrt{(c^{2}-v_{1}^{2})(c^{2}-v_{2}^{2})}}}{c^{2}-v_{1}v_{2}\cos\alpha+{\sqrt{(c^{2}-v_{1}^{2})(c^{2}-v_{2}^{2})}}}}}
$$

The minimum value of $u=\beta_{\mathsf{u}}c$ can be set such that its magnitude and direction in the original reference system are between angles $\varphi_{1},\varphi_{2}$ of both velocities. Therefore, after transformation, shared velocity:

$$
  =\gamma_{i}\frac{1-\beta_{u}\beta_{\mathrm{{i}c o s\varphi_{i}}}}{\sqrt{1-\beta_{u}^{2}}}
$$

$$
\gamma_{1}^{\prime}=\gamma_{2}^{\prime}
$$

Obtain velocity:

$$
  \beta_{u}=\frac{\gamma_{1}-\gamma_{2}}{\gamma_{1}\beta_{1}\cos\varphi_{1}-\gamma_{2}\beta_{2}\cos\varphi_{2}}
$$

The denominator can be expanded using the auxiliary angle formula to find extremes:

$$
\cdots=(\gamma_{1}\beta_{1}-\gamma_{2}\beta_{2}\cos\alpha)\cos\varphi_{1}-\gamma_{2}\beta_{2}\sin\alpha\sin\varphi_{1}\leq{\sqrt{(\gamma_{1}\beta_{1}-\gamma_{2}\beta_{2}\cos\alpha)^{2}+(\gamma_{2}\beta_{2}\sin\alpha)^{2}}}

$$
u=c^{2}{\frac{\left|{\sqrt{c^{2}-v_{1}^{2}}}-{\sqrt{c^{2}-v_{1}^{2}}}\right|}{{\sqrt{c^{2}\left(v_{1}^{2}+v_{2}^{2}\right)-2v_{1}^{2}v_{2}^{2}-2v_{1}v_{2}\cos\alpha{\sqrt{(c^{2}-v_{1}^{2})(c^{2}-v_{2}^{2})}}}}}}

648,MECHANICS,"In a vacuum, there are concentric spherical shells made of insulating material with radii $R$ and $2R$. The inner shell is uniformly charged with a total charge of $Q(Q>0)$, while the outer shell is uncharged. There is also a small insulating sphere with a charge of $+q(q>0)$ and a mass $m$, which can be launched from a point on the inner shell with a certain velocity. The direction can be adjusted, and its motion is confined between the inner and outer shells. Collisions with the inner and outer shells are perfectly elastic, and the charges do not change during collisions. It is known that the sphere can return to its starting point after making one full orbit around the center. If the sphere is launched from point $A$ on the inner shell and it collides with the inner shell a total of $n$ times (counting the final return to the starting point as one collision), determine the minimum launch speed $v$, ignoring gravity.
","Let the distance from the center of the sphere to the position of the ball at the extreme point be $r_{1}$, and the speed be $ u_{\mathrm{_I}}$. According to the conservation of angular momentum and energy: $$ m u_{0}R\sin\theta = m u_{1}r_{1} = L $$ $$ {\frac{1}{2}}{m{ u_{0}}^{2}}+{\frac{k Q q}{R}} = {\frac{1}{2}}{m{ u_{1}}^{2}}+{\frac{k Q q}{r_{1}}} = E = {\frac{k Q q}{2a}} $$ In an appropriate polar coordinate system, we have: $$ p = \frac{L^{2}}{kQq m}, \quad e = \sqrt{1+\frac{2E}{m}\frac{L^{2}}{k^{2}{Q}^{2}q^{2}}} $$ When $Q>0$, the charged ball undergoes hyperbolic motion. Each time it collides with the inner sphere shell, it also collides with the outer sphere shell, and returns to point $A$. The angular displacement around the center during inner and outer sphere collisions is: $$ \alpha = {\frac{2\pi}{2n}} = {\frac{\pi}{n}} $$ The curve $AB$ is its trajectory, with point $O$ as one focus of the hyperbola, and $C$ as the other focus. According to conic section knowledge, the trajectory of the hyperbola to focus $O$ is: $$ r = \frac{p}{e\cos\theta^{\prime}-1} $$ where $\theta^{\prime}$ is the angle between the trajectory of the ball and its polar axis. Considering that: $$ 2a = {\overline{{A O}}} - {\overline{{A C}}} = R - {\overline{{A C}}} = {\overline{{B O}}} - {\overline{{B C}}} = 2R - {\overline{{B C}}} $$ $$ {\overline{B C}} - {\overline{{A C}}} = R $$ Thus the possible trajectory of point $C$ is a hyperbola, and since $r$ continuously increases from $A$ to $\boldsymbol{B}$, the polar axis of the hyperbola must not pass through the trajectory $AB$. To minimize the launch speed $ u_{0}$, and thus minimize energy $E$, $2a$ should be maximized, making $AC$ minimal, satisfying the condition when focus $C$ is at the extended line $OA$ and intersects the asymptote of the hyperbola at point $D$. At this point: $$ \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} $$ The speed is minimal, and according to geometric relations: $$ a+c = R $$ Additionally, according to previous equations: $$ \theta^{\prime} = 0,\quad r = {\frac{p}{e\cos0-1}} = R $$ $$ \begin{array}{c c}{{\theta^{\prime}=\alpha,}}&{{r=\displaystyle\frac{p}{e\cos{\alpha}-1}}=2R} {{}}&{{}} \end{array} $$ $$ {{\displaystyle a=\frac{2\cos{\alpha}-1}{2\cos{\alpha}}R}} $$ Substituting into previous equations: $$  u_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{2k Q q}{m R}\frac{1-\cos\frac{\pi}{n}}{2\cos\frac{\pi}{n}-1}} $$

From the first law of thermodynamics:

$$
\mathrm{d}U_{i}=T_{i}\mathrm{d}S_{i}-p_{i}\mathrm{d}V_{i}
$$  

And the equation of state:

$$
U_{i}=\frac{3}{2}\nu_{i}R T_{i}=\frac{3}{2}p_{i}V_{i}

To solve these two differential equations, we note that due to energy conservation, the total internal energy remains unchanged:

$$
U_{1}+U_{2}={\frac{3}{2}}\left(p_{1}V_{1}+p_{2}V_{2}\right)={\frac{9}{2}}p_{0}V_{0}
$$  

Thus, for the above two equations, we define:

$$
V_{1}=(1+x)V_{0}\quad,\quad V_{2}=(1-x)V_{0}

Simplifying the first equation:

$$
\frac{4}{3}p_{1}V_{2}\mathrm{d}V_{1}+\frac{1}{3}p_{1}V_{1}\mathrm{d}V_{2}+V_{1}V_{2}\mathrm{d}p_{1}=p_{0}V_{0}\mathrm{d}V_{2}

Multiplying both sides by $V_{1}^{1/3}V_{2}^{-2/3}$, the left side conveniently forms a total differential:

$$
\mathrm{d}\left[p_{1}(1+x)^{\frac{1}{3}}(1-x)^{\frac{1}{3}}\right]=-p_{0}{\frac{(1+x)^{1/3}}{(1-x)^{2/3}}}\mathrm{d}x

Due to conservation of internal energy, the pressure at final equilibrium is equal on both sides:

$$
p\cdot2V_{0}=3p_{0}V_{0}\quad,\quad p={\frac{3}{2}}p_{0}
$$  

Thus, we finally obtain the integral equation:

2-\frac{3}{2}(1+y)^{\frac{1}{3}}(1-y)^{\frac{1}{3}}=\int_{0}^{y}\frac{(1+x)^{1/3}}{(1-x)^{2/3}}\mathrm{d}x

Assume the relationship between the atmospheric mass density and the height $h$ above the surface of Mars is given by  $$ \alpha(h)=\rho_{\mathrm{o}}(1+\frac{h}{R_{m}})^{1-n} $$  where $\rho_{\mathrm{0}}$ is a constant, and $\textit{n}(n>4)$ is also a constant.  Derive the expression for the temperature $T(h)$ of the martian atmosphere as a function of the height $h$.  Express the result using the following physical quantities: the mass of Mars $M_{m}$, radius $R_{m}$, molar mass of the atmosphere $\mu$, constant $n$, gravitational constant $G$, and ideal gas constant $R$.","(1) Basic Assumptions and Ideal Gas Law  In the atmosphere at a certain height \( h \) on Mars, a thin horizontally placed box-shaped region is defined. The volume of this region is \( V \), the mass of the atmosphere inside is \( M \), the pressure is \( P(h) \), and the temperature is \( T(h) \). Because the box is very thin, the density, pressure, and temperature of the gas can be considered constant.  According to the ideal gas law:  $$ P(h)V = n R T(h)  $$  The volume of the atmosphere inside the box is:  $$ V = \frac{M}{\rho(h)}  $$  The number of moles of the Mars atmosphere inside the box is:  $$ n = \frac{M}{\mu}  $$  By combining equations (1), (2), and (3), we get:  $$ T(h) = \frac{P(h) \mu}{\rho(h) R}  $$  (2) Determine the Pressure \( P(h) \)  Consider a thin spherical cap-shaped atmospheric layer from height \( x \) to \( x + dx \), subtending a solid angle \( \Delta \Omega \). Let \( \Delta \Omega \) be very small, so that the radial lines on the side of the spherical cap can be considered parallel to each other.  From the force analysis, we know:  $$ [P(x + dx) - P(x)] \cdot \Delta \Omega (R_m + x)^2 + \rho(x) g(x) \cdot \Delta \Omega (R_m + x)^2 dx = 0 $$  That is:  $$ \frac{dP}{dx} = - \rho(x) g(x)  $$  Where the gravitational acceleration from the surface of Mars to height \( x \) is:  $$ g(x) = \frac{G M_m}{(R_m + x)^2} $$  Substituting into equation (6) and integrating, we obtain:  $$ P(h) = G M_m \int_h^{\infty} \frac{\rho(x)}{(R_m + x)^2} dx  $$  (3) Substitute and Determine the Temperature Expression  Substitute equation (7′) into equation (4), and use the density distribution expression provided in the problem:  $$ \rho(x) = \rho_0 \left(1 + \frac{x}{R_m}\right)^{1 - n} $$  Finally, we get:  $$ T(h) = \frac{\mu G M_m}{n R (R_m + h)}  $$  Final Result (Temperature Distribution of Martian Atmosphere)  $$ \boxed{T(h) = \frac{\mu G M_m}{n R (R_m + h)}} $$  This result indicates that the temperature of Mars' atmosphere decreases inversely with height \( h \).",$$T(h) = \frac{\mu G M_m}{n R (R_m + h)}$$
211,MODERN,"In the ground frame S, two trains with an intrinsic length of $L_{0}$ are stationary along the $x$ axis, with the left side of train A located at $x=0$. The gap between the left side of train B and the right side of train A is $D$. At time $t=0$ in the ground frame S, both trains A and B synchronize their carriage times to $t_{A}=t_{B}=0$, and the clocks are located on the left side of each train. At this moment, the two trains start moving with constant accelerations relative to themselves, $a_{A}$ and $a_{B}$.

Let the distance between train carriages AB in frame S be $D(t)$. Express the value of $a_{B}$ when $D(t)\equiv D$ in terms of $L_{0}$, $a_{A}$, and the speed of light $c$.","Since the left end of the train is aligned with the ground clock, the left end of the train can be regarded as a point mass, and thus we can study uniform accelerated motion.

Let the velocity of the left end at time $t$ in the ground frame be $v(t)$, at time $t+d t$, first perform a Lorentz transformation to the rest frame with velocity $v(t)$. In the rest frame, obtain an infinitesimal velocity $adτ$:

Using the proper time formula:

$$
v+dv={\frac{v+adτ}{1+{\frac{v\times adτ}{c^{2}}}}}\rightarrow dv=adτ\left(1-{\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}\right)
$$

$$
dτ={\sqrt{1-{\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}dt \to dv=a{\sqrt{1-{\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}^{3}}}dt
$$ 

Separate variables on both sides, yielding:

$$
at=\int_{0}^{v}{\frac{dV}{1-{V}^{2}/{c}^{2}}}={\frac{v}{1-{v}^{2}/{c}^{2}}}
$$

Solving for the velocity function:

$$
v(t)={\frac{at}{\sqrt{1+\left({\frac{at}{c}}\right)^{2}}}}\to x(t)=x_{0}+\int_{0}^{t}v(t)dt=x_{0}+{\frac{c^{2}}{a}}\left({\sqrt{1+\left({\frac{at}{c}}\right)^{2}}}-1\right)
$$

Select special cases A, B to write the displacement function:

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l}{\displaystyle x_{l A}=\frac{c^{2}}{a_{A}}\left(\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{a_{A}t}{c}\right)^{2}}-1\right)}\ {\displaystyle x_{l B}=L_{0}+D+\frac{c^{2}}{a_{B}}\left(\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{a_{B}t}{c}\right)^{2}}-1\right)}\end{array}\right.
$$

Using the motion on the left side, we can calculate the proper time:

$$
τ=\int_{0}^{t}{\sqrt{1-\left({\frac{v}{c}}\right)^{2}}}dt=\int_{0}^{t}{\frac{dt}{\sqrt{1+\left({\frac{at}{c}}\right)^{2}}}}={\frac{c}{a}}\mathrm{arcsinh}{\frac{at}{c}}
$$

Apply to special cases A, B:

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{{\displaystyleτ_{A}=\frac{c}{a_{A}}\mathrm{arcsinh}\frac{a_{A}t}{c}}}\ {{\displaystyleτ_{B}=\frac{c}{a_{B}}\mathrm{arcsinh}\frac{a_{B}t}{c}}}\end{array}\right.
$$

Taking train A as an example, given the proper time $τ_{A}$, the speed of A at this time is:

$$
v_{A}(τ)={\frac{a_{A}t}{\sqrt{1+\left({\frac{a_{A}t}{c}}\right)^{2}}}}=c\operatorname{tanh}{\frac{a_{A}τ}{c}}
$$

The left side of the train system $(0,τ)$ and the ground frame $(x_{l A},t)$ are aligned, allowing for easy writing of the Lorentz transformation for the right end time and coordinates in the ground frame:

$$
t_{r,A}=t+{\frac{v_{A}L_{0}/c^{2}}{1-v_{A}^{2}/c^{2}}}=t+\cosh{\frac{a_{A}τ}{c}}\left({\frac{L_{0}}{c}}\operatorname{tanh}{\frac{a_{A}τ}{c}}\right)=t+{\frac{L_{0}}{c}}\sinh{\frac{a_{A}τ}{c}}=\left(1+{\frac{a_{A}L_{0}}{c^{2}}}\right)t
$$

$$
x_{r,A}=x_{l,A}+\frac{L_{0}}{1-v_{A}^{2}/c^{2}}=\left(\frac{c^{2}}{a_{A}}+L_{0}\right)\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{a_{A}t}{c}\right)^{2}}-\frac{c^{2}}{a_{A}}
$$

Since $x_{r,A}$ occurs at event S frame $t=t_{r,A}$, the correct $x_{r,A}(t)$ function should replace $t$:

$$
x_{r,A}={\frac{c^{2}}{{\frac{a_{A}}{1+{\frac{a_{A}L_{0}}{c^{2}}}}}}}{\sqrt{1+\left({\frac{a_{A}t/c}{1+{\frac{a_{A}L_{0}}{c^{2}}}}}\right)^{2}}}-{\frac{c^{2}}{a_{A}}
$$

At this moment, the distance between the right side of A and the left side of B is:

$$
=x_{l,B}-x_{r,A}=L_{0}+D+{\frac{c^{2}}{a_{B}}}\left(\sqrt{1+\left({\frac{a_{B}t}{c}}\right)^{2}}-1\right)+{\frac{c^{2}}{a_{A}}}-{\frac{c^{2}}{{\frac{a_{A}}{1+{\frac{a_{A}L_{0}}{c^{2}}}}}}}\sqrt{1+\left({\frac{a_{A}t/c}{1+{\frac{a_{A}L_{0}}{c^{2}}}}}\right)^{2}}
$$

If the distance is constant, then naturally:

$$
a_{B}={\frac{a_{A}}{1+{\frac{a_{A}L_{0}}{c^{2}}}}}
$$","$$

The upper ends are also connected by a very short flexible string (with negligible length). The other end of each rod is free to slide across a horizontal table without friction. The plane formed by the rods and strings is perpendicular to the tabletop, with gravitational acceleration $g$. Initially, the rods are stationary, forming an angle $\theta_{0}$ with the tabletop. When the thin string at the center is cut, the rods fall vertically until they hit the table. What is the velocity $v$ of the rods just before the ends connected at the table touch the tabletop?","Solution: Using the conservation of energy:
Initial mechanical energy: $\frac{1}{2}mgl\sin\theta_{0}$ 
Mechanical energy while in motion (angular velocity is $\dot{\theta}$): translational kinetic energy $^{+}$ rotational kinetic energy $^+$ gravitational potential energy:

58,ELECTRICITY,"An arbitrary multi-terminal resistor network structure, for example with $N+1$ terminals, sets one specific terminal (0 terminal) as the reference for electric potential, setting its potential at 0. The potentials for other terminals (numbered 1, 2, ..., N) are $v_{1}, v_{2}, \ldots, v_{N}$, and the current flowing into the network through these corresponding terminals (negative when flowing out) are $I_{1}, I_2, \ldots, I_n$. Therefore, we have:

$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
V_{1} = a_{11} I_{1} + a_{12} I_{2} + \cdots + a_{1N} I_{N} \\
V_{2} = a_{21} I_{1} + a_{22} I_{2} + \cdots + a_{2N} I_{N} \\

\end{array}
\right.
$$

Due to symmetry, we know that $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$.

This means that the properties of the $N+1$ terminal network can be determined by $\frac{N(N+1)}{2}$ independent parameters: $a_{11}, a_{12}, \ldots , a_{ij}, \ldots , a_{NN} (i<j)$. These parameters are only determined by the resistor network itself and are unrelated to the potential at the terminals or the magnitude of the current flowing in.

Consider a square uniform conductive thin plate as a four-terminal resistor network. The four vertices are sequentially numbered clockwise as 0, 1, 2, 3. If the equivalent resistance between adjacent vertices is ${R}_{1}$ and the equivalent resistance between opposite vertices is ${{R}}_{2}$, use the method of finding the coefficients $a_{i j} (i,j=1,2,3)$ to solve: what is the equivalent resistance between the other two vertices if a pair of adjacent vertices is short-circuited?","For this situation, label the 4 endpoints sequentially as 0, 1, 2, 3. If current flows into endpoint 1 with current I (flowing out from endpoint 0), then:   

$$
V_{1}=a_{11}I=I R_{1}
$$  

Thus, we obtain: $a_{11}=R_{1}$  

Similarly, if current flows into endpoints 2 or 3 with current I, we can respectively obtain: $a_{22}=R_{2}$ $a_{33}=R_{1}$. If current flows into endpoint 1 with current I and flows out from endpoint 2:  

$$
V_{1}^{\prime}=a_{11}I-a_{12}I,V_{2}^{\prime}=a_{21}I-a_{22}I
$$  

At this moment, the potential difference between endpoints 1 and 2 is:  

$$
V_{1}^{\prime}-V_{2}^{\prime}=(a_{11}-2a_{12}+a_{22})I
$$  

Due to symmetry, at this moment, the potential difference between endpoints 1 and 2 should be equal to the potential at endpoint 1 (between 1 and 0) when current flows only into endpoint 1 (out from endpoint 0), thus:  

$$
(a_{11}-2a_{12}+a_{22})I=a_{11}I
$$  

We obtain:  

$$
a_{12}=\frac{1}{2}a_{22}=\frac{1}{2}R_{2}
$$  

[This can also be directly obtained by the condition of current input into endpoint 2, where the potential at endpoint 1 is half of that at endpoint 2 due to symmetry.] Similarly, we obtain:  

$$
a_{23}=\frac{1}{2}R_{2}
$$  

Returning again to the situation with current flowing only into endpoint 1 (flowing out from endpoint 0), at this moment, the potentials at endpoints 2 and 3 are respectively:  

$$
V_{2}=a_{21}I,V_{3}=a_{31}I
$$  

Due to symmetry, the potential difference between endpoints 1 and 2 should be equal to the potential difference between endpoints 3 and 0, thus:  

$$
V_{1}-V_{2}=V_{3}
$$  

Therefore:  

$$
a_{11}I-a_{21}I=a_{31}I
$$  

We obtain:  

$$
a_{13}=a_{31}=a_{11}-a_{12}=R_{1}-{\frac{1}{2}}R_{2}
$$  

Now returning to the required situation of the problem, without loss of generality, we can assume endpoints 3 and 0 are short-circuited and calculate the equivalent resistance between endpoints 1 and 2. In this case, if current flows into endpoint 1 with current I and out from endpoint 2, since endpoints 3 and 0 are short-circuited, there must be current flowing from 0 through the short-circuit wire into endpoint 3. Let the current flowing through the short-circuit wire be $I^{\prime}$, then it can be considered as the original four-terminal situation with current flowing into endpoint 1, out from endpoint 2, and into endpoint 3 with $I^{\prime}$. At this moment, the potential at endpoint 3 is:  

$$
V_{3}=a_{31}I-a_{32}I+a_{33}I^{\prime}
$$  

Because 3 and 0 are practically short-circuited, $V_{3}$ should be 0. Thus we can compute:  

$$
I^{\prime}=\frac{a_{32}-a_{31}}{a_{33}}I=\frac{R_{2}-R_{1}}{R_{1}}I
$$  

We can then compute the potentials at endpoints 1 and 2:  

The potential difference between endpoints 1 and 2:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{V_{1}=a_{11}I-a_{12}I+a_{13}I^{\prime}=(R_{1}-\displaystyle{\frac{1}{2}}R_{2})\displaystyle{\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}}I}}\ {{V_{2}=a_{21}I-a_{22}I+a_{23}I^{\prime}=\displaystyle{\frac{R_{2}}{2}}\displaystyle{\frac{R_{2}-2R_{1}}{R_{1}}}I}}\end{array}
$$  

$$
V_{1}-V_{2}=\frac{(2R_{1}-R_{2})R_{2}}{2R_{1}}I
$$  

Thus, the equivalent resistance between endpoints 1 and 2 is:  

$$
R={\frac{V_{1}-V_{2}}{I}}={\frac{(2R_{1}-R_{2})R_{2}}{2R_{1}}}=(2-{\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}})R_{2}

For the collision process between the square block and the snow, consider the conservation of momentum:  $$ M v = (M + \sigma\gamma u{\mathrm{d}}t)(v - {\mathrm{d}}v) $$  This results in:  $$ \mathrm{d}\upsilon = -\frac{\sigma r v^{2}}{M}\mathrm{d}t $$  The energy loss during the process is:  $$ d E = \frac{1}{2}(M + \mathrm{d}M)(\upsilon + \mathrm{d}\upsilon)^{2} - \frac{1}{2}(M)\upsilon^{2} = -\frac{1}{2}\sigma r\upsilon^{2}\upsilon\mathrm{d}t = -\frac{1}{2}\sigma r\upsilon^{2}\mathrm{d}s $$  In this case, it can be treated as linear motion, and the equation is not influenced by acceleration. Therefore, it can be corrected independently, with the zero-order velocity expression as:  $$ \upsilon_{0} = \sqrt{2g R(1-\cos\theta)} $$  Substituting into the integral:  $$ \delta W = \int f\mathrm{d}s = \int_{0}^{2\pi} -g R(1-\cos\theta)\sigma\boldsymbol{r}\cdot2R\sin\frac{\theta}{2}\mathrm{d}\theta = -\frac{32}{3}g R^{2}r\sigma $$  This gives the energy loss caused by collisions, which we convert into a height correction, then combine it with the correction for the gravitational component of the snow from the first question, resulting in the total reached height:  $$ \begin{array}{l} {{\delta y_{f} = \displaystyle\frac{32}{3}\displaystyle\frac{\sigma R^{2}r}{M}}}{{}}\\ {{\delta y_{g} = \displaystyle\frac{32}{3}\displaystyle\frac{\sigma R^{2}r}{M}}}{{}}\\ {{\delta y = \displaystyle\frac{64}{3}\displaystyle\frac{\sigma R^{2}r}{M}}} \end{array} $$  The two combined terms are both first-order and do not interfere with each other.

37,MECHANICS,"The curling can be approximated as a solid homogeneous cylinder with mass $m$, bottom surface radius $r$, and height $h$. Only the outer edge of the bottom is in contact with the ice surface, which has a friction coefficient $\mu$. The support force of the ice surface on the curling stone is $N=\int_{0}^{2\pi}n(\theta)\mathrm{d}\theta$,
where $n(\theta)$ is the distribution of the support force according to the polar coordinate $\theta$. When the curling is stationary on the horizontal ice surface, $n(\theta)=mg/2\pi$. Assume that the deformation of the outer edge of the curling is very small, and the elastic force satisfies Hooke's law. Therefore, it can be proven that the support force distribution has the form $n(\theta)=n_0+n_1\cos(\theta-\theta_0)$ (where $n_0$, $n_1$, and $\theta_0$ are unknown quantities). If the curling has a velocity $v$ in the positive direction along the x-axis, and also has an angular velocity $\omega$ in the clockwise direction (viewed from above), the curling will generate a lateral acceleration $a$ in the y-direction. It is through this that the athlete can achieve the curling's turn. Find the expression for $a_y$ in the limit case where $v\gg\omega r$.","The deformation at a particular point $\pmb{d}$ is a linear function of its projection distance $\boldsymbol{\mathbf{\rho}}_{x}$ in the direction of maximum deformation:

d = d_{0} + x \tan\alpha

Assuming the direction of maximum deformation is $\theta_{0}$, we have:  

$$
x = r \cos{\left(\theta - \theta_{0}\right)}
$$  

According to Hooke's law:  

$$
n = k d = k d_{0} + k r \tan\alpha \cos\left(\theta - \theta_{0}\right) = n_{0} + n_{1} \cos\left(\theta - \theta_{0}\right)

The friction force acting on the curling stone is proportional to the normal pressure:  

$$

For simplicity, we assume that the \""windward side\"" of the Trisolarian spaceship is a flat surface with an area $S$. During flight, dust floating in the universe may collide with it. We assume that the cosmic dust is composed of particles with rest mass $m$. For an observer on Earth: the spaceship moves at a constant speed of $v _1$, the particles in the cosmic dust have a speed of $v_2$ and move in the same direction as the spaceship, and the particles in the dust are uniformly distributed with a density of $n$.

If the particle density is $n_{0}$ in the rest frame of the cosmic dust itself, we have:  $$ n=n_{0}\gamma_{2}, n^{'}=n_{0}\gamma_{2}^{'} $$  Therefore, we can obtain $n^{\prime}=\frac{\gamma_{2}^{'}}{\gamma_{2}}n_{0}$.    Since $S$ is perpendicular to the direction of velocity, it is identical in both reference frames.

Although the net force at the interface is zero, a torque is generated. This also causes every part of the beam to experience compression/stretch, thereby storing potential energy.

Given the approximation condition ${y}^{\prime}\ll1$:  

$$
R = {\frac{(1+y^{\prime2})^{\frac{3}{2}}}{|y^{\prime\prime}|}} \approx {\frac{1}{|y^{\prime\prime}|}}

Substitute into the previous equation:

For the part of the metal beam with $\mathfrak{x}(\mathfrak{x}>0)$ and above, set up the moment equilibrium at the $\pmb{x}$ position:  

$$
M = \frac{m g}{2}(\frac{l}{2}-x)

Substitute into the previous equation:

Initial conditions:

Substitute $\begin{array}{r}{x=\frac{1}{2}}\end{array}$ to obtain:

By the results of question (1), the metal beam can be equated to a spring with a stiffness coefficient of:

This gives the angular frequency of vertical vibration:

$$
y_{1}\left(\frac{l}{2}\left(1-2\varepsilon\right)\right) = y_{2}\left(-\frac{l}{2}\left(1+2\varepsilon\right)\right) = \lambda^{\prime}

Therefore, the gravitational potential energy of the heavy object is:  

$$

The typhoon system is modeled as an isothermal atmospheric ideal gas with a temperature denoted as ${T}_{0}$. Under strong ionization conditions, it can be considered as consisting of neutral monoatomic gas (with mass $m_{tot}=m_{N}+m_{e}$) and free electrons (with mass $m_{e}$) released through ionization. It is known that each atom can ionize to release at most one electron, with the total number of monoatomic gas particles being $N$.

The rotation speed of the typhoon is ${\overrightarrow{\omega}}=\omega{\hat{z}}$. In this problem, we consider a cylindrical typhoon system with radius ${R}$ and height $H(H \gg R)$. Both the electrons and the positive ions are confined within this cylindrical volume and do not escape. Interactions between free electrons and free electrons, free electrons and positive ions, and positive ions and positive ions are ignored. Additionally, the effects of internal potential distributions within the typhoon on the distribution of free electrons and positive ions are not considered (calculated results can be simplified using $k=\frac{\omega^2}{2k_BT_0}$). The permittivity of free space is $\varepsilon_0$. 

After the typhoon has stabilized, researchers need to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather data within the typhoon system. The UAV has a volume of $V(V^{\frac{1}{3}} \ll R)$ and mass ${m}$. To ensure stable operation during data collection, the UAV must remain at a radius ${r_{0}}$ while orbiting the typhoon center with the same angular velocity $\omega$. It is known that the UAV can only exert thrust in the vertical direction. At time $t=0$, the UAV in stable operation experiences a small radial perturbation and acquires an initial radial velocity $\overrightarrow{v_{0}}$ with $v_{0} \ll \omega r_{0}$. Observations show that the UAV exhibits periodic precession. Solve for its precession angular frequency $\Omega$ (the answer can be expressed in terms of $q_{0}$ and $r_{0}$).","According to the problem statement, a single ideal gas under the isothermal model can satisfy the Boltzmann distribution in any continuous potential energy field distribution. By entering the rotating reference frame of the typhoon, centrifugal potential energy is introduced:

$$
V_{\text{eff}} = -\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2r^2
$$

Thus, the mass density of free electrons and positive ions satisfies:

$$
\rho_{-}(r) = \rho_{-0}e^{m_{\text{e}}kr^2}, \rho_{+}(r) = \rho_{+0}e^{m_{N}kr^2}
$$

Consider that the total number of electrons and positive ions satisfies the normalization condition:

Solving yields:

$$
N = \frac{\int_{0}^{R}2\pi r H\times\rho_{-}(r)dr}{m_e}, N = \frac{\int_{0}^{R}2\pi r H\times\rho_{+}(r)dr}{m_N}
$$

$$
\rho_{-}(r) = \rho_{-0}e^{-m_{e}kr^2} = \frac{k m_{e}^2N}{\pi H(e^{m_{e}k R^2}-1)}e^{m_{e}kr^2}
$$

$$
\rho_{+}(r) = \rho_{+0}e^{-m_{N}kr^2} = \frac{k m_{N}^2N}{\pi H(e^{m_{N}k R^2}-1)}e^{m_{N}kr^2}
$$

From

$$
PV = nRT
$$

It follows that

$$
P(r) = \left(\frac{\rho_{+}}{m_{N}} + \frac{\rho_{-}}{m_{e}}\right)k_{B}T_{0}
$$

$$
P(r) = \left(\frac{k m_{e}N}{\pi H(e^{m_{e}k R^2}-1)}e^{m_{e}kr^2} + \frac{k m_{N}N}{\pi H(e^{m_{N}k R^2}-1)}e^{m_{N}kr^2}\right)k_{B}T_{0}
$$

We prioritize considering the electric field intensity at the maximum electric field, analyzing symmetry $\vec{E} = E(r)\hat{r}$

$$
E(r) = \frac{\int_{0}^{r}(e\rho_{+} - e\rho_{-})(2\pi r \, dr)}{2\pi r\varepsilon_{0}H} = \frac{N e}{2\pi r H\varepsilon_{0}}\left[\frac{e^{m_{N}kr^2}-1}{e^{m_{N}k R^2}-1} - \frac{e^{m_{e}kr^2}-1}{e^{m_{e}k R^2}-1}\right]
$$

Considering when $\pmb{E}$ reaches maximum value, it satisfies:

$$
\frac{dE(r)}{dr} = 0
$$

Simplifying, the $r_{\text{max}}$ at maximum electric field satisfies the equation when $r = r_{\text{max}}$:

$$
\left[\frac{e^{m_{N}kr^2}-1}{e^{m_{N}k R^2}-1} - \frac{e^{m_{e}kr^2}-1}{e^{m_{e}k R^2}-1}\right] - 2kr^2\left[m_{N}\frac{e^{m_{N}kr^2}}{e^{m_{N}k R^2}-1} - m_{e}\frac{e^{m_{e}kr^2}}{e^{m_{e}k R^2}-1}\right] = 0
$$

Substituting the data, solving yields:

$$
r_{\text{max}} = 719.96 \, \mathrm{m}
$$

At this time:

$$
E_{\text{max}} = \frac{N e}{2\pi r_{\text{max}}H\varepsilon_{0}}\left[\frac{e^{m_{N}kr_{\text{max}}^2}-1}{e^{m_{N}k R^2}-1} - \frac{e^{m_{e}kr_{\text{max}}^2}-1}{e^{m_{e}k R^2}-1}\right] = -9.83 \times 10^{18} \, \mathrm{V/m}
$$

Since:

$$
\left|E_{\text{max}}\right| > E_m
$$

It can break down air.

For analyzing the forces on the drone in the ground reference frame, the buoyancy it experiences satisfies:

$$
\vec{F}' = (\rho_{-}(r_{0}) + \rho_{+}(r_{0}))V g\hat{z} + (\rho_{-}(r_{0}) + \rho_{+}(r_{0}))V\omega^2r_{0}(-\hat{r})
$$

In the $\hat{r}$ direction, list the force balance equation:

$$
E(r_{0})q_{0} - (\rho_{-}(r_{0}) + \rho_{+}(r_{0}))V\omega^2r_{0} = -m\omega^2r_{0}
$$

Substituting specific values, solving gives:

$$
q_{0} = \frac{-m\omega^2r_{0} + \left(\frac{k m_{\circ}^2N}{\pi H(\circ^{m_{\circ}kr_{0}^2}-1)}e^{m_{\circ}kr_{0}^2} + \frac{k m_{N}^2N}{\pi H(\circ^{m_{N}kr_{0}^2}-1)}e^{m_{N}kr_{0}^2}\right)V\omega^2r_{\circ}}{\frac{N e}{2\pi r_{0}H\varepsilon_{0}}\left[\frac{e^{m_{N}kr_{0}^2}-1}{e^{m_{N}kr_{0}^2}-1} - \frac{e^{m_{e}kr_{0}^2}-1}{e^{m_{\circ}kr_{0}^2}-1}\right]}
$$

Further consider the force balance equation in the $\hat{z}$ direction:

$$
F_{0} + (\rho_{-}(r_{0}) + \rho_{+}(r_{0}))V g - m g = 0
$$

Substitute specific values, solving yields:

$$
F_{0} = -(\rho_{-}(r_{0}) + \rho_{+}(r_{0}))V g + m g
$$

$$
F_{0} = m g - \left(\frac{k m_{e}^2N}{\pi H(e^{m_{e}k R^2}-1)}e^{m_{e}kr_{0}^2} + \frac{k m_{N}^2N}{\pi H(e^{m_{N}k R^2}-1)}e^{m_{N}kr_{0}^2}\right)V g
$$

With conservation of angular momentum:

$$
L_{0} = m r_{0}^2\omega
$$

Assume a relative stable position $\boldsymbol{r}_{0}$ with a perturbation distance $\delta r$, and write out the dynamic equation:

$$
m\ddot{\delta r} = \frac{L_{0}^2}{m(r_{0}+\delta r)^3} + E(r_{0}+\delta r)q_{0} - [\rho_{-}(r_{0}+\delta r) + \rho_{+}(r_{0}+\delta r)]V\omega^2(r_{0}+\delta r)
$$

Analyze and calculate the results in each term:

Effective centrifugal force term:

$$
\frac{L_{0}^2}{m(r+\delta r)^3} = \frac{L_{0}^2}{m r_{0}^3} + \frac{\partial\frac{L_{0}^2}{m r^3}}{\partial r}\delta r = \frac{L_{0}^2}{m r_{0}^3} - 3m\omega^2\delta r
$$

Radial electric field term:

$$
E(r_{0}+\delta r)q_{0} = E(r_{0})q + \frac{N e q_{0}}{2\pi H\varepsilon_{0}r_{0}^2}\left[\frac{(2k m_{N}r_{0}^2 - 1)e^{m_{N}kr_{0}^2} + 1}{e^{m_{N}k R^2} - 1} - \frac{(2k m_{e}r_{0}^2 - 1)e^{m_{e}kr_{0}^2} + 1}{e^{m_{e}k R^2} - 1}\right]\delta r
$$

Radial component of buoyancy term:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
-[\rho_{-}(r_{0}+\delta r) + \rho_{+}(r_{0}+\delta r)]V\omega^2(r_{0}+\delta r) =& -[\rho_{-}(r_{0}) + \rho_{+}(r_{0})]V\omega^2r_{0} - \ldots
\end{array}
$$

$$
\ldots \frac{k N V\omega^2}{\pi H}\left[\frac{(2k m_{N}r_{0}^2 + 1)e^{m_{N}kr_{0}^2}}{e^{m_{N}k R^2} - 1}m_{N}^2 + \frac{(2k m_{e}r_{0}^2 + 1)e^{m_{e}kr_{0}^2}}{e^{m_{e}k R^2} - 1}m_{e}^2\right]\delta r
$$

Since

$$
\frac{L_{0}^2}{m r_{0}^3} + E(r_{0})q_{0} - [\rho_{-}(r_{0}) + \rho_{+}(r_{0})]V\omega^2r_{0} = 0
$$

Zero-order term sum is zero, thus only considering the first-order terms, we obtain the precession angular frequency:

A charged particle with rest mass $m_{0}$ and charge $-q (q>0)$ is shot at high speed into the positive $y$ direction from the origin. It experiences a drag force equal to $q c B$ in magnitude, opposite to the direction of velocity. It is known that the charged particle comes to a stop after turning through an angle $\theta_{0} (\theta_{0} > \frac{\pi}{2})$ in the direction of velocity, and at point $A$ on its trajectory, the velocity is parallel to the $x$-axis ($\theta_{A} = \frac{\pi}{2}$).

647,MECHANICS,"This problem discusses the motion and forces on a particle in a rapidly oscillating field.  First, we discuss the one-dimensional theory in a rapidly oscillating field. Let $q$ denote the coordinate of the particle. For a particle in a potential field $V_{0}(q)$ with mass $m$, if there is a rapidly oscillating force $f( \boldsymbol{q},t)$ acting on it (the angular frequency $ \omega$ of $f$ is very high), its equation of motion is:  $$ m{ \ddot{q}}=F_{0}=-{ \frac{ \mathrm{d}V_{0}}{ \mathrm{d}q}}(q)+f(q,t) $$    The core of the theory is to divide the actual motion into fast motion (high-frequency oscillation) and slow motion (average motion): fast motion is denoted as $x(t)$, and slow motion is denoted as $X$. Due to the high frequency, the response of $x$ is very small, that is $x \ll X$. Expanding the above equation:  $$ m \ddot{X}+m \ddot{x}=- \frac{ \mathrm{d}V_{0}}{ \mathrm{d}q} \Big \vert_{X}- \frac{ \mathrm{d}^{2}V_{0}}{ \mathrm{d}q^{2}} \Big \vert_{X} \cdot x+f(X,t)+ \frac{ \partial f}{ \partial x} \Big \vert_{X,t} \cdot x $$    First, solve for fast motion: $ \begin{array}{r}{m \ddot{x}=- \frac{ \mathrm{d}^{2}V_{0}}{ \mathrm{d}q^{2}} \Big \vert_{X} \cdot x+f(X,t)} \end{array}$, which is evidently a forced oscillation. Considering the high-frequency approximation, that is $ \begin{array}{r} { m \omega^{2} \gg \frac{ \mathrm{d}^{2}V_{0}}{ \mathrm{d}q^{2}} \bigg|_{X}} \end{array}$, we obtain  $$ x=-{ \frac{1}{m \omega^{2}}}f(X,t) $$    Thus, in fact, when studying rapidly oscillating forces, the second term on the right side of the equation does not have any practical effect.   Next, solve for the slow motion. Substitute the result of the fast motion into the actual dynamical equation to obtain the slow motion. Extending this situation to three dimensions, if $  abla \times f=0$, the effective potential $F_{ \mathrm{eff}}=-  abla V_{ \mathrm{eff}}$ can be written down.

267,THERMODYNAMICS,"We divide medium molecules into two categories: one is non-polar molecules, such as carbon tetrachloride; the other is polar molecules. For polar molecules, the centers of positive and negative charges are separated, forming an intrinsic dipole moment $\vec{p}_{i}$, such as in a water molecule. Under the influence of an external field, the positive and negative charge centers of non-polar molecules shift, forming a dipole. This mechanism is called induction polarization. For polar molecules, the intrinsic dipole moment rotates to a stable equilibrium position under the influence of the external field. This process is called orientation polarization. In this problem, we discuss the orientation polarization of the medium.

Assuming the dipole moment of a water molecule is $p_{w}$ and considering a system with a number density of water vapor molecules $n$, the interaction energy between the water dipole moment $p_{w}$ and the applied electric field is assumed to follow the Boltzmann distribution.

254,THERMODYNAMICS,"In a vacuum, there exists an electrically neutral plasma cloud composed of electrons and protons. The plasma cloud is in thermal equilibrium within a non-uniform external magnetic field, with an equilibrium temperature of $T$. It is known that the mass of an electron is $m_{e}$, the charge of an electron is $-e$, the mass of a proton is $m_{p}$, the charge of a proton is $e$, the Boltzmann constant is $k_{B}$, and the vacuum permeability is $\mu_{0}$. The electrostatic effects of the plasma are neglected.

The distribution function of electrons and protons (distinguished using the index $\alpha$, which can be used to simplify calculations) in six-dimensional phase space $(x, y, z; v_{x}, v_{y}, v_{z})$ is defined as:

$$
f(x, y, z; v_{x}, v_{y}, v_{z}):={\frac{d{\mathrm{P}}}{d x d y d z d v_{x} d v_{y} d v_{z}}}

where $\mathrm{P}$ is the probability density of finding a particle at position $(x, y, z)$ with velocity $(v_{x}, v_{y}, v_{z})$. Statistical physics indicates that if there exist additive conserved quantities in the single-particle motion of electrons or protons, such as energy $E$ and momentum $p$, then the thermal equilibrium distribution function $f_{\alpha}$ is:

f_{\alpha} \propto \exp\left(-{\frac{E_{\alpha} + V_{\alpha} p_{\alpha} + \dots}{k_{B} T}}\right)

289,OPTICS,"By utilizing crystal materials with non-uniform thickness or non-uniform refractive indices, humans invented convex lenses. Now, let's reverse the thought process: use an ideal convex lens model combination to reconstruct a crystal material with a varying refractive index!

Consider infinitely many ideal semi-convex lenses, each placed equidistantly with an angular spacing of $\alpha$ between them. Each semi-convex lens is infinitesimally thin, allowing them to be arranged without mutual interference. These lenses are halved along their optical centers, and all optical centers are overlapped at the origin $O$ without crossing one another. Although there are infinitely many semi-convex lenses, $\alpha$ is an infinitesimal quantity, so the total angular range remains finite and does not extend infinitely in rotation. Finally, the focal length of each convex lens is $f$, which is an infinitely large quantity. However, the quantity $f\alpha = r_{0}$ is a finite, non-zero characteristic length in the limit. Below, all answers to the subsequent questions will be expressed in terms of $r_{0}$.

To solve the problem of determining the position and direction of a light ray perpendicular to the first lens upon exiting the last lens, we first perform an equivalence transformation: in fact, by tracing the trajectory of the light ray as it propagates between the lenses, it can be found that this problem is completely equivalent to the refraction of a light ray inside a spherical medium with a refractive index that varies with radius. Determine the refractive index distribution $n(r)$ of the sphere.

In classical mechanics, the ground state energy of a harmonic oscillator is zero. However, in quantum mechanics, due to the influence of the uncertainty principle, the harmonic oscillator’s ground state energy is not zero but rather $\begin{array}{r}{\cdot\frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega=\frac{1}{2}h\nu.}\end{array}$ The ground state energy of a harmonic oscillator, $\cdot{\frac{1}{2}}\hbar\omega$, is also called the vacuum zero-point energy.

$$
\overrightarrow{E}_{(z,t)}=\sum_{j}\widehat{\epsilon}_{j}A_{j}q_{j}(t)\sin{(k_{j}z)}

Substituting each harmonic oscillator into the equation satisfied by electromagnetic waves in a vacuum:
$$

\ddot{q}_{j}+c^{2}k_{j}^{2}q_{j}=0

$$
E_{0}=\frac{1}{2}h\nu

This energy is referred to as the vacuum zero-point energy. As a result, even in the absence of photons, there exists a Casimir force between two parallel conducting plates in a vacuum.

Next, we use a simplified model to theoretically calculate the magnitude of the force arising from the Casimir effect.

To account for this effect, an exponential term is introduced to truncate the high-energy modes. The truncation position is arbitrary, so we expect it will not affect any measurable quantities. Assume that when summing over different electromagnetic wave modes to obtain the total energy, a Boltzmann factor is introduced, i.e.,

489,MODERN,"The Bohr model holds historical significance as the first semi-classical quantum model of the hydrogen atom. It explained the challenges of classical electrodynamics regarding electron radiation and atomic stable states, as well as the results of spectroscopic observations at the time. Due to the limitations of quantum theory during its early development, it underwent modifications by Sommerfeld and others, eventually leading directly to the establishment of the Schrödinger equation by Schrödinger and others, which serves as the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics.

In the Bohr model, the principal quantum number $n$ simultaneously determines the energy and angular momentum of the electron state, which is actually incorrect. Through observation of hydrogen atoms in electric fields and magnetic fields, we point out that degenerate states under the same principal quantum number $n$ with different angular quantum numbers $l$, magnetic quantum numbers $m$, and even spin quantum numbers $s$ will experience energy level splitting. Specifically, some states' energy levels increase, while others decrease, and spectroscopic observations can reveal distinct spectral lines resulting from electronic level transitions between different states. The Stark effect is a typical effect when the hydrogen atom couples with an electric field. This problem attempts to estimate of the magnitude of energy level splitting due to the Stark effect using a semi-classical approach.

Consider the slow evolution of the electron's orbital in space under the influence of a weak uniform electric field $\vec{E}$. First, consider a simpler situation where at time $t=0$, the normal vector $\vec{n}$ of the plane of the electron's orbit and the electric field strength $\vec{E}$, along with the axis pointing from the nucleus to the pericenter of the orbit (the $x$-axis), are all situated in the $xOz$ plane, with an angle $\theta$ between the latter two. Use the perturbation method to prove that the magnitude of the angular momentum of the electron's orbit does not change over time, and the orbit merely precesses around the direction of the electric field $\vec{E}$ (that is, rotates around the axis). Determine this angular velocity $\Omega$. Given the orbital energy $-U$, eccentricity $e$, electron mass $m$, and the magnitude of charge for both the atomic nucleus and electron as $q$.

Hint: The so-called perturbation method refers to calculating the instantaneous derivative of the dynamical conserved quantity of the original system under the action of the newly added perturbing force at each moment. Substitute the position and velocity of the periodic motion of the original system into this derivative and calculate the periodic average. Finally, this averaged quantity is interpreted as the time derivative of a dynamical conserved quantity along the instantaneous orbit.

Even today, with transportation methods and technology rapidly changing, bicycles are still considered the most labor-saving and superior non-motorized means of transportation and are highly regarded for their outstanding environmental protection benefits. Early research on bicycles focused on gear coupling, pedal acceleration, and similar processes, but the study of bicycle control stability has been challenging. Why does a bicycle with two wheels remain stable while moving and not topple over? For over a hundred years, this question has intrigued many famous mechanicians, physicists, and mathematicians, resulting in more than a hundred renowned papers published in various languages such as English, German, French, Russian, and Italian. In 1897, the French Academy of Sciences even offered a reward for this research. Today, the study of the control and riding stability of bicycles with different structures and parameters continues to be a hot topic in the engineering field.
(In this problem, the rider does not hold the handlebar and imparts no force on it)
A ridden bicycle can ensure its own stability and not fall over. Based on our own experience, the faster the speed, the better the stability. However, is it possible to attach some devices to the bicycle to make it stable and upright even when stationary? Below, we provide a schematic of a bicycle structure with an attached momentum wheel, where a brushless motor is fixed to the bicycle body, connected to a momentum wheel, and can be driven by the motor to achieve any desired angular velocity.

Next, we simplify this system. Since we are now studying the upright stability of the bicycle in a non-moving state, we can consider the front and rear wheels, body, and motor as a rigid body, abstracted as a homogeneous rigid rod that can only rotate in the plane around the contact point with the ground. The rod has a length $L$, mass $M$, and the momentum wheel connected to the rod's end can be driven by the motor to achieve any angular velocity. The momentum wheel is viewed as a disk with mass $m$ and radius $r$. (Ignore lateral slip at point $O$)

If the bicycle body obtains a clockwise rotation angle $\theta$ , the angular velocity that the previously stationary momentum wheel subsequently needs to acquire is 

In fact, when the bicycle tilt angle changes, the angular velocity and angular acceleration of the momentum wheel should also change correspondingly. We assume that sensors installed on the bicycle body can record the tilt angle $\theta$ and feedback to the motor, allowing the momentum wheel to acquire an angular acceleration of size $\dot{\omega}=K\theta$. To bring the bicycle back to a balanced position, solve for the dependency of $\omega$ on time $t$. ( $\theta<<1$, ignore any resistance, at $t=0$, $\theta=\theta_{0},\dot{\theta}=0$, and the angular velocity of the momentum wheel is 0)",,

539,MECHANICS,"**Transverse Waves on a String**

In this problem, we describe waves using the negative phase convention. In this convention, the most general form of a traveling wave is expressed as  

$$
\psi(x,t)=A e^{i(\pm k x-\omega t)}
$$  

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $k$ is the magnitude of the wave vector, the $""+""$ sign represents a wave traveling to the right, and the $""-""$ sign represents a wave traveling to the left. $A$ is the complex amplitude (its magnitude corresponds to the amplitude, while its phase angle contains the information about the phase). Next, we will consider transverse waves on a string, whose wave equation is  

$$
\frac{\partial^{2}\psi}{\partial x^{2}}-\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2}\psi}{\partial t^{2}}=0
$$  

where $u$ is the wave velocity. When $k$ and $\omega$ in the traveling wave expression satisfy $\omega/k=u$, it is a solution to the wave equation above. Due to the linearity of the wave equation, the superposition of solutions to the traveling wave is also a solution to this equation.  

Both ends A and B of a string are fixed to supports. We establish a coordinate axis with the midpoint (point O) as the origin and the positive direction of the $x$-axis pointing to the right. Thus, the coordinates of endpoints A and B are $±l/2$, where $l$ is the length of the string. At a point with a coordinate of $a$ on the string, a driver C with an angular frequency of $\omega$ is installed, causing all mass elements on the string to oscillate with an angular frequency of $\omega$.  

Let the amplitude reflection coefficient at the string's connection point with the supports be $\boldsymbol{r}$, which is defined as the ratio of the complex amplitude of the reflected wave to that of the incident wave at the reflection point. Assume that the incident wave between C and B is  

$$
A e^{i(k x-\omega t)}
$$  

We can introduce an inhomogeneous term into the wave equation to model the effect of the driver $C$:  

$$
\frac{\partial^{2}\psi}{\partial x^{2}}-\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2}\psi}{\partial t^{2}}=F\delta(x-a)e^{-i\omega t}
$$  

Here, $F$ characterizes the amplitude of the driving force. The function $\delta(x-a)$ is a delta function with the following properties: it exhibits a very narrow, tall pulse centered near ${\boldsymbol{x}}={\boldsymbol{a}}$, with the area under the pulse curve equal to 1. Using this property, we can write the relationship satisfied by the wave functions $\psi_{1}$ and $\psi_{2}$ to the left and right of C. This relationship is also known as the continuity condition.  

Finally, express $A$ in terms of $F$, $k$, $l$, and $a$.",,

Some call it a ""space elevator,"" while others refer to it as an ""orbital lift."" However, they do not realize that due to the limitations imposed by physical laws, building a space elevator on the Blue Star is unrealistic. In contrast, several years later, on Mars, which is farther from the sun, space elevators can ""stand tall.""

As early as the Book of Genesis in the Bible, humans hoped to jointly construct a towering tower that reaches from the ground to the sky—the Tower of Babel—to spread their fame. The person who first proposed the concept of a space elevator should be Russia's ""father of rockets""—Tsiolkovsky. His envisioned space elevator extends from the ground to the geostationary orbit, tens of thousands of kilometers high. As the elevator rises, the gravity inside gradually decreases. When cargo reaches the endpoint with the elevator, its speed is enough to maintain synchronous orbital movement around the Earth. Therefore, the station at the geostationary orbit is in a completely weightless state.

In 1979, Arthur C. Clarke's science fiction novel, ""The Fountains of Paradise,"" first brought this advanced concept of the space elevator into the public's view. Since then, space elevators have widely existed in various science fiction works. Whether it's the space elevator made with advanced nanomaterials in ""The Three-Body Problem"" or the three orbital lifts during the three-way division among Union, AEU, and Human Reform League in ""Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"" their basic concepts and principles are the same.

Nowadays, we can occasionally hear some related news reports, whether it's the Japanese company ""Obayashi Corporation"" planning to complete the first space elevator by 2050, or a Canadian company proposing a new space elevator plan. Regardless of whether these are just commercial companies engaging in hype, such news does indeed cause more people to wonder—are we really close to the era of abandoning rockets and embracing space elevators?

Is this really the case? How far away are we from the technology required to build space elevators? We will conduct a detailed analysis in this question (the space elevators mentioned below are all built at the equator, and any bending is not considered).

In fact, whether a material is destroyed or not depends not only on the magnitude of the force but also on the area over which the force acts. This is easy to understand; under the same amount of tension, thinner pipes are more easily pulled apart. Therefore, we need to use ""stress (force divided by the area of action)"" to measure whether a space elevator will be damaged. If the cross-sectional area of the space elevator is uniform, then obviously the place where the force is greatest, in other words, the geostationary orbit area, is the most prone to breaking.

Do we have any way to make the stress inside the entire space elevator equal? Of course we do! We know that the tension increases with height, so the cross-sectional area of an equal strength (internally equal tensile stress) space elevator should also increase with height. Therefore, the optimized space elevator design changes from a uniformly thick ""catenary"" to a funnel-shaped ""catenary"" with a thick top and thin bottom.

In this question, we use the following model: A mass at the end of the space elevator is considered infinitely large to ensure that only tensile forces act inside the elevator, so there is no force acting at the contact point with the ground. The elevator is thick at the top and thin at the bottom, with each cross-section having an equal tensile stress of σ. The material density is ρ, and the material elongation is not considered. The cross-sectional area at the ground level is \(A_{0}\). Solve the following problem:

Find the expression for the cross-sectional area \(A_{x}\) at a distance \(X\) from the center of the Earth, expressed in terms of \(g\), \(R\), \(\omega_{0}\) (Earth's rotational angular velocity), \(\sigma\), \(\rho\), and \(A_{0}\).",,

Inserting a non-magnetic metal rod or a ferromagnetic rod will change the magnetic field distribution of the inductor coil, subsequently influencing the circuit's response. For a non-magnetic rod, due to electromagnetic induction, the changing magnetic field will produce an induced current within the metal rod, accompanied by Joule heating, thus generating an equivalent non-contact resistance $R$.

The surface states of topological insulators have unique electromagnetic wave propagation characteristics, involving **Berry phase**, **Chern number**, and **nonlinear effects**. These concepts can be understood through step-by-step derivation and analysis.

Consider the surface states of a three-dimensional topological insulator, whose low-energy effective Hamiltonian matrix is:
$$
H = v_F (\sigma_x k_y - \sigma_y k_x) + m \sigma_z
$$

Where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity, $\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices, $k_x$ and $k_y$ are the wave vectors in momentum space, and $m$ is the mass term.

Let's define $\vert \psi(\mathbf{k})\rangle$ as the normalized eigenvector. Since there are two eigenvectors, for convenience we take the one with the negative eigenvalue (although the final results are clearly the same).

Berry connection is defined as:
$$
\vert A\rangle =\begin{pmatrix}
\langle \psi(\mathbf{k}) | \frac{\partial }{\partial k_x} | \psi(\mathbf{k})\rangle\\
\langle \psi(\mathbf{k}) | \frac{\partial }{\partial k_y} | \psi(\mathbf{k})\rangle
\end{pmatrix}

Under the combined influences of turbulent disturbances, precipitation, horizontal winds, and more complex convergence and uplift factors, their distribution becomes highly irregular. However, as an approximate model, we can consider only the vertical influences. This is because for the electric field of thunderstorm clouds, what truly concerns everyday life is essentially just the ""lightning that reaches the ground."" This portion of lightning can be understood by the vertical electric field surpassing the atmospheric breakdown limit, and the accumulation of the vertical electric field is of paramount importance.

Within thunderstorm clouds, negative ions are more likely to dissolve into raindrops and fall, resulting in a general pattern of positive charges above and negative charges below. As precipitation occurs, charge separation will continue to expand until the electric field becomes sufficiently large for lightning to occur.

Let us consider two cloud layers of equal thickness, with their thickness being much smaller than their vertical separation. Precipitation exists between them. Each raindrop has a radius of $r$, density $\rho$, carries negative charge, and the charge of each raindrop is proportional to its radius: $q = br$. The number density of raindrops is $n$. The friction force acting on a falling raindrop is proportional to the first power of its velocity: $f = -kv$, where $k$ is a constant. The resistance experienced by ions moving through the air can be expressed using the modified Stokes' formula: $F = -Ku$, where $K$ is a constant, and $u$ is the magnitude of the ion's velocity. Suppose all positive ions carry a single positive charge $e$, and compared to the electric field force, the gravitational force acting on the ions can be ignored. The gravitational acceleration is $g$, and the vacuum permittivity is $\epsilon_0$.

It is assumed that the plasma is sufficiently sparse, so the particle only experiences the magnetic field generated by the plasma lens, and even if it enters within the cylindrical plasma lens, collisions between the particle and the plasma can be completely ignored.

566,ADVANCED,"Alice and Bob are playing a game, roughly described as follows. Charlie is the host of the game. In each round, Charlie gives each of Alice and Bob a bit, \(x, y\), which means that each of them gets a number, 0 or 1. After receiving the bits, Alice and Bob each reply to Charlie with a bit, \(a, b\). To win the game, it is required that \(x\,\text{and}\, y = a\,\text{xor}\,b\). Alice and Bob can devise a strategy before the game, but they cannot communicate during the game.

We consider the following strategy:
A pair of entangled quantum bits can be described as
\[\ket{\phi}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\ket{00}+\ket{11}\right)\]
Here, \(\ket{mn}\) refers to the state of the system composed of two quantum bits, meaning the quantum state of the system where the quantum bit in Alice's hand is in state \(\ket{m}\) and the quantum bit in Bob's hand is in state \(\ket{n}\). The game process is that Alice first performs a measurement based on the \(x\) she received, and then Bob performs a measurement based on the \(y\) he received. They determine their reply bits \(a, b\) based on the measurement results.

Let's define the following states:
\[\begin{align*}
        \ket +&=\frac{1}{\sqrt2}\ket0+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket 1&
        \ket -&=\frac{1}{\sqrt2}\ket0-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket 1\\
        \ket{a_0}&=\cos\theta\ket0+\sin\theta\ket1&\ket{a_1}&=-\sin\theta\ket0+\cos\theta\ket1\\
        \ket{b_0}&=\cos\theta\ket 0-\sin\theta\ket1&\ket{b_1}&=\sin\theta\ket 0+\cos\theta\ket 1
    \end{align*}\]
where \(\theta=\pi/8\).

The specific measurement strategy is as follows:

**Alice's Measurement:**

* When Alice's random number \(x\) is 0, she uses the measurement basis \(\{\ket{1}, \ket{0}\}\).
    * If she measures \(\ket{1}\), the value she sends is 1.
    * If she measures \(\ket{0}\), the value she sends is 0.
* When Alice's random number \(x\) is 1, she uses the measurement basis \(\{\ket{+}, \ket{-}\}\).
    * If she measures \(\ket{+}\), the value she sends is 0.
    * If she measures \(\ket{-}\), the value she sends is 1.
   
**Bob's Measurement:**

* When Bob's random number \(y\) is 1, he uses the measurement basis \(\{\ket{b_1}, \ket{b_0}\}\).
    * If he measures \(\ket{b_1}\), the value he sends is 1.
    * If he measures \(\ket{b_0}\), the value he sends is 0.
* When Bob's random number \(y\) is 0, he uses the measurement basis \(\{\ket{a_0}, \ket{a_1}\}\).
    * If he measures \(\ket{a_0}\), the value he sends is 0.
    * If he measures \(\ket{a_1}\), the value he sends is 1.

579,THERMODYNAMICS,"Percolation is a geometric phase transition with profound significance in the study of localization and related topics. We use a model here to understand it. On a 2D lattice, lattice points can be occupied by black particles or be empty (white particles). The probability of placing a black particle is $p$, and the probability of being empty is $q=1-p$, where $N$ is the total number of particles.

It is clear that the probability of large clusters $\mathrm{\Delta}s$ appearing, where $n_{s}(p)$ at low values of $p$ is significant, decreases rapidly with $s$. However, when $p$ is large, one observes the emergence of macroscale $s$, which is the localization phenomenon. The transition occurring with $p$ is referred to as percolation. To study this problem, consider the influence between lattice points and transform it. We provide some approximate treatments: firstly, the number density of black particles is redefined as a dynamically changing $n$. We treat it as a function containing time $t$ and lattice coordinates $(x,y)$, and continuoize $(x,y)$ into a two-dimensional real number set instead of integer lattice coordinates. In our simple continuum model, the flux of number density between lattice points is exactly proportional to the gradient of the number density (consistent with the two-dimensional diffusion problem). However, in the actual discrete model, when localization occurs, a lattice point with certain probability is in a connected large cluster, with an internal number density always being 1; or the lattice point is located in an empty space or a small cluster with other probabilities, where the number density is less than 1. This links the continuous model with the discrete model: if the continuous model's $n(x,y)$ ultimately forms a stable distribution $n(r)$ rotationally symmetric around the origin and time-independent, where $r=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$, in this model, take a circle of radius $r_{0}$ such that the total number of particles inside is $N$, representing the characteristic particle number of a large cluster, and the edge particle number density $n(r_{0})$ should be related to the critical probability $p_{c}$ at which localization begins.

A large disk with a sufficient radius acts as the driving wheel and rotates counterclockwise around a fixed axis $o$ with a constant angular velocity $\Omega$. There is another small disk (with a radius of $r$) that can freely rotate around a fixed axis $O_{1}$, which acts as the driven wheel. This small disk is pressed against the large disk with a force of magnitude $N$ by the axis $O_{1}$. If the large and small disks are coaxial, the small disk will be driven by the large disk and rotate with the same angular velocity. Now we consider the situation where the distance between the two axes is $d \neq 0$. It is assumed that the pressure between the two disks is uniformly distributed. We can also add lubricant between the two disks, turning the friction between them into ""wet friction."" The characteristic of this is: for two mutually contacting surface elements of size $\Delta\sigma$, the wet friction force on one of them can be expressed as

$$
\Delta f = -\gamma v_{r} \Delta\sigma

He assumed that the Earth initially had a molten crust, and the exothermic process of solidification from the outside to the inside led to a gradual increase in the thickness of the solid crust. The thickness of the solid crust simultaneously determined the rate of heat dissipation outward (according to the classical heat conduction and heat radiation theorem). This allowed him to calculate the relationship between the rate of heat dissipation and time. Given the latent heat of solid-liquid phase transition per unit mass of the crust as $L$, the density of the solid as $\rho$, the temperature of the molten material as $T$, and the current surface temperature approximately as $T_0$, as well as the Stefan constant $\sigma$ and Fourier's thermal conductivity coefficient $\kappa$, estimate the age of the Earth.",,

However, they do not realize that due to the limitations imposed by physical laws, building a space elevator on Blue Planet is unrealistic. In contrast, years later, on Mars, which is further from the Sun, space elevators can ""stand tall.""

As early as in the Book of Genesis in the Bible, humans hoped to jointly construct a giant tower reaching from the ground to the sky—the Tower of Babel—to proclaim their fame. The person who first proposed the concept of a space elevator should be the Russian ""father of rockets,"" Tsiolkovsky. The space elevator he envisioned would extend from the ground to the geosynchronous orbit tens of thousands of kilometers high. As the elevator ascends, the internal gravity gradually decreases. When cargo reaches the endpoint via the elevator, its speed already allows it to maintain synchronous orbital motion around Earth. Therefore, the synchronous orbit station is in a state of complete weightlessness.

In 1979, Arthur C. Clarke's science fiction novel ""The Fountains of Paradise"" introduced the revolutionary concept of the space elevator to the public's attention. Since then, space elevators have been widely present in various sci-fi works. Whether it is the space elevator made of advanced nanomaterials in ""The Three-Body Problem"" or the three orbital lifts operated by Union, AEU, and Human Reform League in ""Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"" the basic concepts and principles are the same.

Nowadays, we occasionally hear some related news reports, either from Japan's company ""Obayashi Corporation"" planning to build the first space elevator by 2050, or from a Canadian company proposing new space elevator schemes. Regardless of whether these are commercial companies creating hype, such news indeed prompts more people to wonder—are we really close to the era of abandoning rockets and embracing space elevators?

Is this really the case? How far away are we from the technology needed to build a space elevator? We will conduct a detailed analysis in this matter (the space elevators discussed here are all constructed at the equator, with no consideration for any curvature).

In Tsiolkovsky's vision, the space elevator following Earth's rotation would reach a certain height, after which a satellite released freely would automatically become a geostationary satellite. Calculate the height $l_{1}$ of the space elevator in this model. Given are: gravitational acceleration $g$, Earth's radius $R$, and Earth's rotation period $T_{day}$.",,

515,MECHANICS,"Collisions are one of the simplest mechanical interactions between objects, and they are the process of energy and momentum exchange between objects. The cascade of one-dimensional collisions resulting in chain events provides a simple model for a series of natural phenomena dominated by continuous collisions. When studying such systems, the physical quantities we are interested in are the proportion of energy or momentum transmitted by the collision cascade and its dependence on the coefficient of restitution \( e \) and the collision mass ratio. We arrange \( n(n\gg1) \) balls (with masses \( m_{i}(i=1,2,...,n) \), adjustable) between an initial ball with mass \( M \) (fixed) and an end ball with mass \( m \) (fixed). Only the first collision between adjacent balls is considered. All collisions are inelastic with a coefficient of restitution \( e \) (very close to 1).

Recently, Ricardo and Lee proved that when the mass distribution of the cascade ball chain is such that the mass \( m_{i} \) of each ball is the geometric mean of the masses of the two adjacent balls \( \sqrt{m_{i-1}m_{i+1}} \), the efficiency of kinetic energy and momentum transfer between the initial and final balls is maximized. For a system of \( n \) balls, the maximum transfer efficiencies of kinetic energy and momentum between the initial and final balls can be expressed as \( r_{K n},r_{p n} \).

108,OPTICS,"When electromagnetic waves undergo total internal reflection at an interface, it has been observed that under certain circumstances, the reflected wave experiences a lateral shift along the interface relative to the point of incidence. This phenomenon is historically known as the ""Goos-Hänchen shift."" The core concept is that during total internal reflection, the reflected wave acquires an additional phase $Φ(\theta)$, which depends on the angle of incidence $\theta$ (typically decreasing as the angle of incidence increases, becoming zero at the critical angle $\theta$ for total internal reflection, with its derivative with respect to the angle of incidence becoming infinite at the critical angle). When the incident wave is not a perfect plane wave, electromagnetic waves with closely spaced but different angles of incidence can interfere. The condition for this interference to occur is that the reflected waves from different angles of incidence must achieve equal phase by undergoing a lateral shift $d$ along the interface.

Now, by solely considering the presence of thermal resistance (ignoring factors such as heat leakage and friction), an ideal cycle process—the internally irreversible Carnot cycle—is introduced. The internally irreversible Carnot cycle satisfies the following three conditions:

(i) The working substance undergoes a quasi-static Carnot cycle;  

(ii) Due to the thermal resistance between the working substance and the heat source, the temperatures $T_{1},T_{2}$ of the two isothermal processes that the working substance undergoes are different from the heat source temperatures $T_{H},T_{L}$, specifically: $T_{H} > T_{1} > T_{2} > T_{L}$. In this way, there is a finite temperature difference between the heat source and the working substance, allowing heat conduction to occur over a finite period, resulting in power output from the cycle;

Physics is not only the study of the composition and forms of interaction of matter, but also how new physical concepts are constructed at different theoretical levels, and more remarkably, how profound connections between physical concepts at different levels are revealed. Based on this idea, let's look at the following questions concerning connections, which are themselves interconnected.

In fact, diffusion is also a typical transport process. We can consider a gaseous medium, where a dilute component (thus the mechanical effects caused by its diffusion can be neglected) is composed of (quasi)particles with effective charge and mass $q, m$. Before discussing diffusion, let's consider the following question: if the system maintains a temperature $T$, and a uniform magnetic field $\pmb{B}$ is applied to the gas. Then, when scattering of particles is not considered $(\gamma\rightarrow0)$, the particles originally conforming to the Maxwell distribution in the medium will now rotate around the magnetic field. Next, we consider the evolution caused by the diffusion of particles in the external magnetic field. We let a large number of particles start at rest from the origin. Its dynamics equation can be phenomenologically written as:

$$
m{\ddot{r}}=f-\gamma{\dot{r}}+q{\dot{r}}\times B
$$

where $\pmb{f}=-\gamma\pmb{v}$ reflects the scattering (or damping) of the particles, and $q\dot{\pmb r}\times\pmb B$ is the force caused by the magnetic field, with the magnetic field taken as ${\boldsymbol{B}}= B e_{z}$. Meanwhile, $\pmb{f}$ reflects the forces caused by thermal factors, which is a function that randomly changes over time and is independent of the particle's location, with an average value of zero. Compute the average of the angular momentum in the $z$ direction $J=\langle m(x{\dot{y}}-y{\dot{x}})\rangle$.

An infinitely long leaky dielectric cylindrical object, with a radius of $R$, an absolute permittivity $\varepsilon$, initially stationary and uncharged as a whole. The charge carriers have an extremely small mass $m \to 0$, charge magnitude $q$, and a mobility $\mu$ (i.e., the drift velocity of the charge carriers under a uniform electric field $E$ is $v = \mu E$). The number density of carriers is $n$. A cylindrical coordinate system $(z,r,\theta)$ is established inside the cylinder, with the origin being the center of the circular top surface, the $z$ axis pointing axially outward along the cylinder, and $r$ pointing radially outward. During the process, the charge volume density $\rho$ and current densities $j_{r}, j_{\theta}$ inside the cylinder will vary with time $t$, and they are also functions of spatial coordinates $r$ and $\theta$. Due to the translational symmetry along the $z$ axis, the current density in the $z$ direction, $j_{z}$, will always be zero, and all non-zero physical quantities are independent of the $z$ coordinate.

Firstly, keep the cylinder stationary, and slowly apply a uniform magnetic field $B$ along the cylinder axis. Then, maintain the uniform magnetic field and slowly rotate the cylinder steadily around the axis in the positive $\theta$ direction with an angular velocity $\omega$. Ignore the centripetal force required for the circular motion of the charge carriers (due to $m \to 0$), and also ignore the magnetic field generated by the rotation of the charge carriers. In the steady state, the charge carriers will redistribute in the radial direction, resulting in a non-zero charge and current distribution $\rho, j_{r}, j_{\theta}$ in the ground frame.
