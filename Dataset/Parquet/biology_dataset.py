The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy. The main stages are glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation (electron transport chain).",

Brown rabbits are easily spotted by predators against the snow, while white rabbits blend in. Over time, more white rabbits survive and reproduce, passing on the white fur trait. Eventually, the population becomes predominantly white-furred due to this 'survival of the fittest' â€“ that's natural selection."
